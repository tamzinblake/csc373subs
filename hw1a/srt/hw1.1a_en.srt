1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
The correct answer in the first case is 0.8.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
This is just 1 minus 0.2.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:13,000
If X and Y are independent, then we just take the product of those 2 things, which is 0.04.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
And in the last case, it turns out X and Y are independent but just by a coincidence

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
because the probability of Y is independent of what X says,

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
and therefore, the outcome would just be 0.6.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Put differently no what matter value X assumes, whether it's X or not X,

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Y is always 0.6 probability so it must be that P(Y) is 0.6.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
You can actually compute this using total probability

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:45,000
where P(Y) equals P(Y|X) times P(X) plus P(Y|¬X) times P(¬X).

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
When you plug in the numbers, you get 0.6 times 0.2 over here;

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
0.6 times 0.8 over here, the complement of 0.2.

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
And if you regroup this, or you put the 0.2 and the 0.8 together into one,

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
you end up with 0.6.
