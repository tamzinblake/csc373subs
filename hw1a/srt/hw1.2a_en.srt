1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
And the answer is exponential.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Suppose we resolve each variable at a granularity of 20 different values,

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
so there's 20 different bins for x, 20 for y, and 20 for θ.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Then the joint table over all of those will be 20^N

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
where N is the number of state dimensions.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
That's an exponential expression.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
There is unfortunately no easy way around it.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
That's the biggest disadvantage of the grid-based localization method

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
or the histogram method, that the scale of memory is exponential,

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
which means it's not applicable to even problems with 6 dimensions,

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
because you can't really allocate memory for 6 dimensions.
