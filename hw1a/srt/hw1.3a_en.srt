1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
And here are my answers.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The prior for fire is 0.001

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,000
times the probability that the neighbor now correctly says, yes, it burns, which is 0.9.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
He lies with a probability of 0.1, so the complement is 0.9.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,000
This gives us 0.0009.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
For the complement, the prior of no fire, is 0.999,

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
but now the neighbor would have lied, which multiplies with 0.1,

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
which gives us 0.0999.

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Now, these two values don't add up to 1.

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:45,000
The normalizer will be 1 over these two things, which is about 9.92.

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:56,000
So multiplying these with their normalizer gives us approximately 0.0089 and 0.991.

12
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
So the answer your neighbor gave you, "yes, it burns",

13
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:05,000
raised your probability from 0.001 to 0.0089.

14
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
It's still small, but it's significantly larger.

15
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
In fact, it's approximately 0.9 times as large as the initial probability.

16
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,000
And the reason why that's the case is it relates to the 0.9 probability of speaking the truth.

17
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
It's not exactly 0.9 because of normalization, but it's approximately 0.9.
