00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Hi, I'm Kathleen and Sebastian wrote a piece of code for you

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
that I am now going to demonstrate.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
So, the main class is a class called robot.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,000
This robot lives in a 2-dimensional world of size 100 meters by 100 meters.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
It can see 4 different landmarks that are located at the following coordinates:

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
20, 20; 80,80; 20,80; and 80,20.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
So, here's how we make such a robot.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
So it's really easy.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
All you have to do is call a function robot() and assign it to a variable myrobot.

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
So, now that we can do things with my robot.

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
For example, we can set a position.

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
These 3 values are the X coordinate, the Y coordinate, and the heading in radians,

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
and this command assigns those values to the robot.

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Let's print these things out

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
And down here you see the output

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
X=10, Y=10, and heading=0.

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Next, let's make the robot move. This robot moves 10 meters forward and doesn't turn.

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
So, let's print the resulting position.

19
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
And here we go, you can see that it's now at 20, 10, and 0.

20
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
It moved 10 meters forward from 10,10 to 20,10.

21
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Now, let's make the robot turn by pi/2 and move 10 meters.

22
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
So, now the robot is heading in the direction of pi/2,

23
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
and it moved forward 10 meters in the Y direction, instead of the X direction.

24
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
So, as you can tell it's really easy to program.

25
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
The last thing I want to show you is how to generate measurements.

26
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
There's a really easy command called sense

27
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:46,000
and all it does is give you the distance to the 4 landmarks, 1, 2, 3, and 4.

28
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
For now this is all you need to know about the class robot

29
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
that Sebastian has programmed for you.

30
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
You might want to spend some time familiarizing yourself with the code

31
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
to see how this is all configured.
