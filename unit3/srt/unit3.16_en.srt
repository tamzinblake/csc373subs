1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
So, let me make these alpha values explicit and ask you another question.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Is it possible that P1 is never sampled

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
in the resampling step? Yes or no?

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Please just check one.
