1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
And the answer is 0.0777 approximately,

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
and the way to obtain this is

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
for this particle to never to be drawn in the resampling phase,

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
we always have to draw 1 of the following 4 particles.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Those together have a probability of 0.6 to be drawn,

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
which contrasts to the 0.4 for P3.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
So for 5 independent samplings to draw 1 of those 4,

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,000
we get a total probability of 0.6^5,

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
which is approximately 0.0777.

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Put differently, there is about a 7.7% chance that this particle over here is missing,

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
but with almost 93% probability we'd have this particle included.

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
If we had instead of P3, gone for P1 over here,

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
which has a much smaller probability of being drawn,

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
then this 0.07 will be as large as 0.59,

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
which is 0.9^5.

16
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Now this means with about 60% chance

17
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:11,000
we will lose particle 1, and only with a 40% chance we will include it.

18
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Put differently, the particles with small importance weights

19
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
will survive at a much lower rate than the ones with larger importance weights,

20
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
which is exactly what we wish to get from the resampling step.
