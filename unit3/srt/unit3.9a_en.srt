1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
And here's my solution.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,000
I initialized the robot myrobot using the function robot().

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
I set the coordinates to be 30, 50, and pi/2.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I then apply the motion command, assign the result to myrobot again

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
with -pi/2 and 15.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
I print the measurement values.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I move again, and I print the measurement values again,

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
and when I hit run,

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
this is exactly what I get.
