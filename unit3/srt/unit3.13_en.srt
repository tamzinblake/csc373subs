1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
I now want you to take each of these particles

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
and simulate robot motion.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Depending on the heading direction,

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
this might yield a different directions.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:19,000
So, each of these particles shall first turn by 0.1 and then move by 5 meters.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
We already implemented something just like this for individual robot motion.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Now I'd like you to apply this to the entire particle set.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
So, please go back to the code and make a new set P

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
that is the result of this specific motion turning by 0.1

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
and moving forward by 5.0

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
to all of those particles in P.
