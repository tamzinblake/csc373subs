1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
And the answer are those 2.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Those, I used in a Job Talk in 2003.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
But I previously applied at Stanford and actually received an offer,

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
which I turned down, in 1998.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
And in my earlier work, I didn't understand particle filters,

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
and I did everything with this filter over here.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
But came 2003, I was a big, big fan of particle filters

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
and my Job Talk talked about a version of those

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
that applied them to the somewhat more involved

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
robot mapping problem.
