1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
And the correct answer is: of course they will eventually matter.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
So "No" is the correct answer, and let me show this to you.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Again, assume our 4 landmarks

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
and consider a robot facing to the right, to this direction.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
We get a certain set of distances

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
that is invariant to the orientation.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
But now this robot moves, and we get a new set of distances.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
And now orientation matters.

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
If we assume a different initial orientation,

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
like this one over here,

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
and that robot moves,

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
its measurements will be very, very different.

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
So orientation does matter in the second step of particle filtering,

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
because the prediction is so different for different orientations.

15
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Let's go and program this.
