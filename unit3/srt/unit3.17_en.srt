1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Let me now ask the same question about P3

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
which is the particle with the largest importance weight.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Please check yes or no.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Is it possible that P3 is never sampled in the resampling step?

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Yes or no?
