1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Let me ask you a few questions.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
We had measurement updates and motion updates.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
In the measurement update, we computed posterior over state

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
given the measurement.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
And it was proportional to, up to normalization,

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
our probability of the measurement,

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
given the state times p of the state itself.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
In the motion update, you compute

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
a posterior over distribution, 1 time step later,

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
and that is the convolution of the transition probability

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
times my prior.

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Now those formulas, those should look familiar.

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
This is exactly what you implemented.

14
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
You might not know you implemented this; let me explain

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
to you how you implemented it.

16
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
This distribution was a set of particles.

17
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
A thousand particles, together, represented your prior "x".

18
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
These were importance weights.

19
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
And technically speaking, the particles

20
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
with the importance weights

21
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
are a representation of distribution.

22
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
But we wanted to get rid of the importance weights

23
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
so by resampling, we work the importance weights

24
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
back into the set of particle so the resulting particles,

25
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
the ones over here, would represent the correct posterior.

26
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
You've implemented this.

27
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I'm just telling you what the math is behind this.

28
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
This, you also implemented.

29
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
This was your set of particles again,

30
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
and you sampled from the sum

31
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
by taking a random particle over here

32
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
and applying the motion model with a noise model

33
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
to generate a random particle, "x-prime".

34
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
As a result, you get a new particle set

35
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
that is the correct distribution after the robot motion.

36
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
So you recognize the math, and hopefully

37
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
you understand how your code implements this math.

38
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
You can prove all kinds of interesting facts about this math.

39
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
For example, you can prove convergence if the number of particles goes to infinity.

40
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
It is obviously approximate.

41
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Particles are not an exact representation.

42
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
And it was amazingly easy to program.

43
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
So when you go over your particle code

44
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
you realize you implemented a fairly involved

45
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
piece of math that is actually the same

46
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
for all the filters we talked about so far.

47
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
The same math underlies our histogram filter

48
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
we talked about in Class No. 1.

49
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
And the same math for Gaussians

50
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
is the Kalman filter we talked in Class No. 2.

51
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
So let me ask you an interesting question.

52
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Which of the 3 filters did Sebastian use

53
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
in his Job Talk at Stanford?

54
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Histogram Filters, Kalman filters,

55
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Particle Filters or None of the above?

56
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Check one or all that apply

57
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
and, of course, you can't really know unless

58
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
you Google me and look up my Home Page.

59
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Then you might find out some evidence.

60
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
So just take a random guess

61
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
and I'll tell you the answer in a second.

62
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I should say I was hired by Stanford,

63
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
in 2003, into a tenured Associate Professor position

64
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:54,000
so obviously my Job Talk wasn't that bad.
