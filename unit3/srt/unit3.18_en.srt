00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
So, I want to ask you a tricky question and maybe you can calculate this.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
So, what is the probability of never sampling P3?

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
To answer this question assume we make a new particle set

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:18,000
with N=5 new particles where particles are drawn independently and with replacement.
