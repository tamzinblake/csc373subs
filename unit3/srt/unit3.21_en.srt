1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Here's a quiz.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Will orientation or heading never play a role?

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
And the answers are:

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Yes: Never,

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
so we always get a random set of orientations,

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
or No: eventually they matter.
