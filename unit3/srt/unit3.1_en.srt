00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
So before I start today's class, I'd like to take you on a trip

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:09,000
that I recently did to share some of the things that excite me in my life with all of you.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
I actually went to Washington D.C. and the highlight of the day, for me,

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
was to visit the National Museum of American History.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Some of you might know this, in 1998

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
a team lead by Wolfenbarger and myself

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
put a robotic tour guide into this museum.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
This robot was in the museum for about 2 weeks

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
and it led kids and visitors of the museum through the exhibit.

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
It did localization similar to what I taught you before.

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
It used a learned map of the environment.

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
We programmed by hand the specific location of exhibits,

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
and the robot was able to say something.

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
The robot was able to smile and to frown, and as you can see in this video

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
sometimes even kids climbed onto it.

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
But today I'm here to see Stanley.

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Stanley has been here for a couple of years now on exhibit,

18
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
our robot that won the DARPA Grand Challenge, and it was really fascinating

19
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
to see the thing that we've built and visited

20
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
in its own little room in the Smithsonian Museum.

21
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
This exhibit has been made specifically to celebrate Stanley's victory,

22
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
and in exploring this exhibit, again, I found that

23
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
the curators had actually put some program code on the wall for people to understand,

24
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
and as I zoom in you can see "kalman".

25
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
So, at the time we were already working with Kalman filters,

26
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
And in our parameter file, as shown here, the word "kalman" appears many times,

27
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
so what I've been teaching you last class about Kalman filters

28
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:41,000
really had a major role to play in making Stanley the robot win the Darpa Grand Challenge.

29
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
So these are really deep, emotional moments for me,

30
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
going back to the past and seeing what we've done and how it's being preserved.

31
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
But I want to share this with everybody here, because it's part of my life

32
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
and it's part of what we've done in building self-driving cars,

33
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
and the methods I'm teaching you in this class

34
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
are esenntially the same methods as we used back in Stanley

35
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
and in Junior when we did the Urban Challenge.
