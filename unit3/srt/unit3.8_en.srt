So thank you Kathleen. I really appreciate it.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
This code has a little bit more stuff than you just talked about.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
It actually assimilates noise, but the noise variables are all set to 0,

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
and those noise variables are really important for particle filters

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
so you can play with those if you like.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
In fact, there's a function over here called set noise,

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
that allows you to set them.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
And then later on we have a function that makes kind of no sense right now,

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
but it will be important as we implement particle filters, called measurement probability.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
And this accepts a measurement and tells you how plausible this measurement is.

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
It's kind of the key thing for the survival of the fittest rule in particle filters.

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
So, if you look through the code don't be confused by this function; we will actually use it later.
