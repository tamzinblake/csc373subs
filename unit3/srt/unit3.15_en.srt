1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
And it turns out it's actually harder than you think,

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
but I'm going to show you how to do it,

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
and once you've done it, you can use the exact same code

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
forever for any particle filter.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
But let me be precise what resampling actually means.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,000
We are given N particles, each of which has 3 values,

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
and there's N of them, and they also now have weights.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
These are simple floats or continuous values.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Let's call big W the sum of all these weights,

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
and let's normalize them just for the consideration of what to do,

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
and it's called the normalized weights, alpha.

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:45,000
So alpha 1 would be the weight 1 divided by the normalizer W,

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
and so on all the way to alpha N,

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:56,000
and obviously it goes without saying that the sum of all alphas is now 1,

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
since we normalized them.

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
What resampling now does is it puts all these particles

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
and their normalized weights into a big bag,

18
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
and then it draws with replacement N

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
new particles by picking each particle with probability alpha.

20
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
So, for example, alpha 2 might be large

21
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
so we're going to pick this one, P2.

22
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Alpha 3 might also be large so we pick that one.

23
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Alpha 4 might be really small but just by chance you might actually pick it.

24
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
So, we have P4 over here, and then we might pick alpha 2, again.

25
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
So, you get 2 versions of P2, perhaps even 3 versions of P2,

26
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
depending on the probabilities.

27
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
We have N particles over here.

28
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
We do this thing N times, which is why I said with replacement

29
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
we can draw multiple copies of the same particle,

30
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
and in the end those particles that have a high-normalized weight alpha over here

31
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
will occur likely more frequently in the new set over here.

32
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
That's called resampling.

33
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
So, to make sure you understand this

34
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
let me ask you a couple of quizzes.

35
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Suppose we have 5 particles with the following importance weights:

36
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:16,000
0.6, 1.2, 2.4, 0.6, and 1.2.

37
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
If I, in the process of resampling,

38
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,000
randomly draw a particle in accordance to the normalized importance weights,

39
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
what is the probability of drawing P1,

40
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
P2,

41
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
P4, and P5?
