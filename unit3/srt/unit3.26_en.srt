1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Now fast forward to 2012.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
We built the Google Car.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
We're now using multiple methods.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
We use histogram methods and particle methods.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,000
The main difference to what you've learned, so far, is two-fold.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
The main difference that we've learned so far

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
is the Robot Model.

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
The vehicle is actually modeled as a system

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
with 2 non-steerable wheels and 2 steerable wheels.

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
That's often called a Bicycle Model

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
because half of it,this thing over here,

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
acts like a bicycle.

13
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
The big difference is the Sensor Data.

14
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Instead of using landmarks,

15
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
we get this really elaborate road map,

16
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
and then we take a single snapshot

17
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
and we match that snapshot into the map.

18
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
And the better the match,

19
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
the higher the score.

20
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
And then on top of it, we have additional sensors, like GPS.

21
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
We also have Inertial Sensors.

22
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
And I'm not going to go into those at all,

23
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
but the methods I taught you

24
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
are rich enough to handle these additional sensors.

25
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
So you've just learned about the gist of

26
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
the method in which the Google Car is able

27
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
to find where it is, and where other cars are.

28
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
When you build a system, you have to

29
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
dive into these more elaborate methods.

30
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
But I think it's very much doable.

31
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
It's very easy to replace

32
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
the current simple motion model with the slightly

33
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
more sophisticated, for what's called

34
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
a Bicycle Model, and it's easy to write

35
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
a correlation function that looks into map data

36
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
and computes normalized correlations

37
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
of measurement images in a big pixel map.

38
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'll leave this an an exercise

39
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
so if you want to hack your own car

40
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
and make it drive itself, have fun.

41
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I just want to congratulate you.

42
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
You've actually, in these 3 classes,

43
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
learned pretty much as much as

44
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
any of my Stanford student learns

45
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
in my Specialized AI classes on robotics, when it comes to robot perception.

46
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
In fact, you've learned pretty much what there is to know

47
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
to become a successful practitioner in robotics.
