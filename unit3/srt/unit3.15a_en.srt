1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
And the answer is 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.1, and 0.2,

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:15,000
and to see, we just have to normalize those importance weights.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
The sum of those numbers over here is 6.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
So, we divide 0.6 by 6. We get 0.1.

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
1.2 divided by 6 is 0.2.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
2.4 divided by 6 is 0.4.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Obviously those over here add up to 1.
