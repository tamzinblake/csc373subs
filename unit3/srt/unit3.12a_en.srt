00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Here's 1 possible solution if we iterate the following loop 1000 times

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,000
we create an object called robot, and we append this object to our growing list p,

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
and when we're done we have 1000 particles,

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
and let me do something I might regret,

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
which is let me just print out this entire set of particles with print P,

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
and what I get is 1000 items that look just like this over here.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Here we have an X, a Y, and a heading direction all generated at random.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
So, if you look through those you'll find there's a lot of those.

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
So, we now have a set of 1000 particles,

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
each of which just looks like one of these dots over here,

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
and each of which has exactly 3 values associated,

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
an X, a Y, and an orientation.
