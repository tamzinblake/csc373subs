1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
So, here's one possible solution: we construct p2 as a temporary particle set

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
with a later set p equals p2, so this is just a temporary set.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
We then go through all the particles, again, and here is the tricky line.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:21,000
We append to list p2 the results of our motion of 0.1 and 5.0

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
applied to the ith particle chosen from the original particle set.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
So this applies the move command to each of the particles

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
exactly the same way we applied move to the robot motion before.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
When we're all done we reset p=p2.

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
So, we've done the full recursion of applying our motion update

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
to our full particle set.

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
If you've gotten this far then you got about half of particle filters implemented,

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
unfortunately it's the easy half,

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
but the difficult half isn't that much more difficult.
