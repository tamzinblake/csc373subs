1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
And here is how I would do it.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I would just call the function set_noise() with the parameters I specified

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
for the object my_robot, and when I hit run now

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
I get different values like those, or those, or those.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
In fact, every single time I hit run

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
I get a different set of values.
