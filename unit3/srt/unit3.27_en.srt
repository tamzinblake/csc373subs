1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
In the next class, I will tell you about

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
robot motion, how to make the robot move.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
So we're going to move beyond the idea of

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
just state estimation, finding out where we are

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
or where the other cars are.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
And we're going to move to the fascinating topic:

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
how to use all this to decide where to move.

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
So in the next class, I'll talk about a basic

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
AI method called "search",

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
in particular, "A* search", which is an algorithm

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
invented by my colleague, Nils Nilsson, at Stanford,

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
and I will apply it to the problem of planning

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
robot trajectories and making it move

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
in real time.

15
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
So I'll see you in the next class.
