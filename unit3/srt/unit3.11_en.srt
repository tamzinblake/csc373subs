1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
So, now we know about our class robot

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
who can turn and then move straight after the turn,

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
and which also can sense the distance to 4 designated landmarks,

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:20,000
L1, L2, L3, and L4, and these distances

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
comprise the measurement vector of the robot.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
We told you the robot lives in a world of size 100 x 100,

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
and what this means if this robot falls off 1 end,

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
it disappears on the other.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
So, it's a cyclic world.

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
So, let's now talk about particle filters.
