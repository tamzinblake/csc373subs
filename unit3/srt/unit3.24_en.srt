00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
So one thing I want to stress here is that

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
you've just programmed a full particle filter.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
So you got, from me, kind of a very

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
primitive and rudimentary robot simulator

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
that uses landmarks as a way of doing measurements,

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
and it uses three-dimensional robot coordinates,

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
so it's a little bit better than the stuff we talked about in previous classes;

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
it's not quite a Google car yet.

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
And you solved the estimation problem.

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,000
In fact, you solved this problem in 30 lines of code.

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
That is an amazing small amount of code

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
for something that's amazingly powerful.

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
And you can reuse these 30 lines of code

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
in pretty much all problems you might study

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
that require particle filtering; they're very generic.

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
So let me get back to the theory of particle filtering.
