00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
So here's our first programming exercise.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I'd like you to make a robot that starts at coordinates 30 and 50,

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
and it heads north, which means its heading direction is pi/2.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:20,000
It then turns clockwise by pi/2, which means you subtract pi/2 from the heading direction,

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
and it moves 50 meters.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
It then senses, and I want you to print out the sensor measurements.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
It then turns clockwise by pi/2, again, and moves 10 meters this time,

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
and I just want you to print out the sensor measurements after this entire procedure.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
So, there are 2 print statements for the sensor over here

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
and the sensor measurements over here.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
So, here's the output I would like your program to generate.

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
After the first motion, the first measurements will be 39 + something,

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
46, 39, and 46,

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:59,000
and then after the second motion I expect to see 32, 53, 47, 40.

15
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Of course, there's lots of decimal-point numbers over here,

16
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
but these are the numbers I would expect you to output.

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
So, have fun coding it.
