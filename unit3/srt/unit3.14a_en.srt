1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
And this can be done in a single line of code.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
You construct the list W by appending

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
the output of the function measurement_prob() applied to the ith particle

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
with the argument of the actual measurement,

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
and as you can see over here most of them look insanely unlikely.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
So, they have exponents -146, -24.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Some of them are more likely, the ones that are closer to the truth like -5.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Those are the particles that should really survive,

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
whereas those ones over here with a -126,

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
those are really ready to die off

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
because they are so far away from the truth we really don't need them anymore.

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
So, in the final step of the particle filter algorithm,

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
we just have to sample particles from p

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
with a probability that is proportional to its corresponding w value.

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Particles in P that have a large value over here

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
should be drawn more frequently than the ones with a small value over here.

17
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
How hard can that be?
