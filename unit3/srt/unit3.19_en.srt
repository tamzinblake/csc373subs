00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
So, what I'd like you to do next is to modify our algorithm

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
to take the lists of particles and importance weights,

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
to sample N times the replacement N new particles

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
with a sampling probability proportional to the importance weights.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Or in the code now that we calculated our new particles

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
and the corresponding importance weights, construct a new particle set p3,

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
which we will call p, again, when everything is said and done,

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:36,000
so that the particles in p3 are drawn from p according to the importance weights w.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Now to warn you, this is more difficult than it looks like.

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm going to show you a trick in a second, so if you fail to do this don't worry.

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I give you a chance to do it right now, but then I'm going to tell you

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
a little bit more about how to organize this

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
in an efficient way and you get a second chance.

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
So, try it out, see if you can do it, and if you fail

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
look for my advice and then try it again.
