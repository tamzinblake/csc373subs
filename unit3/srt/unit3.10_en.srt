00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Next, I'd like you to play with the noise.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Our class robot has built-in noise variables.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
One is for forward motion.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
This is a added Gaussian noise variable to the motion you command.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
The same for turn and the same for the sensor measurements.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
And as I scroll down I find the function set_noise()

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
lets me set those values to values other than zero.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
So, I want you, into your code, set these values as follows:

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:34,000
forward noise equals 5.0, turn noise equals 0.1, and sense noise equals 5.0.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
So, please fit this into your code.
