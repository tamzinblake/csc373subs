Next, I'd like you to play with the noise.
Our class robot has built-in noise variables.
One is for forward motion.
This is a added Gaussian noise variable to the motion you command.
The same for turn and the same for the sensor measurements.
And as I scroll down I find the function set_noise()
lets me set those values to values other than zero.
So, I want you, into your code, set these values as follows:
forward noise equals 5.0, turn noise equals 0.1, and sense noise equals 5.0.
So, please fit this into your code.
