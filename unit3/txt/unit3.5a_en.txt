Well the histogram filters tend to be approximate, because the world tends not to be discrete.  So localization, for example, is clearly an approximate filter.

It turns out Kalman filters are also approximate, and that's a much more subtle observation.  It turns out Kalman filters only are exact for linear systems, whereas the world happens to be non-linear.  Now this goes into a lot of deep math that I don't want to get into here.

But you should understand that both of these filters are not exact.  Both of them tend to be just approximations of the correct posterior distribution.
