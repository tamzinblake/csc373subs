And here's my solution.

I initialized the robot myrobot using the function robot().

I set the coordinates to be 30, 50, and pi/2.

I then apply the motion command, assign the result to myrobot again with -pi/2 and 15.

I print the measurement values.

I move again, and I print the measurement values again, and when I hit run, this is exactly what I get.
