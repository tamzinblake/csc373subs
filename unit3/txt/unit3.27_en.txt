In the next class, I will tell you about robot motion, how to make the robot move.

So we're going to move beyond the idea of just state estimation, finding out where we are or where the other cars are.

And we're going to move to the fascinating topic: how to use all this to decide where to move.

So in the next class, I'll talk about a basic AI method called "search", in particular, "A* search", which is an algorithm invented by my colleague, Nils Nilsson, at Stanford, and I will apply it to the problem of planning robot trajectories and making it move in real time.

So I'll see you in the next class.
