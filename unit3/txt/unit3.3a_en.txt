And here the histogram filter scores better.

Even though it was discrete, it was able to represent multiple bumps, which the Kalman filter couldn't, so it's unimodal.

If you forgot this, go back to the past class and look at this.

The Kalman filter was a single Gaussian, which is by definition unimodal, whereas the histogram filter can have bumps over arbitrary grid cells.
