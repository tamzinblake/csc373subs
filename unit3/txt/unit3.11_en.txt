So, now we know about our class robot who can turn and then move straight after the turn, and which also can sense the distance to 4 designated landmarks, L1, L2, L3, and L4, and these distances comprise the measurement vector of the robot.

We told you the robot lives in a world of size 100 by 100, and what this means if this robot falls off 1 end, it disappears on the other.

So, it's a cyclic world.

So, let's now talk about particle filters.
