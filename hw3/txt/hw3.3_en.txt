In question 3 I'd like to quiz your intuition.

Suppose we run a particle filter with N equals 1 particle. What will happen?

It'll work just fine, perhaps with a slightly larger error.

It ignores robot measurements.

It ignores robot motion.

It likely fails.

Or none of the above.

You can check multiple boxes on the left.
