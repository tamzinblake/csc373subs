00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
In question 3 I'd like to quiz your intuition.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Suppose we run a particle filter with N equals 1 particle.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
What will happen?

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
It'll work just fine, perhaps with a slightly larger error.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
It ignores robot measurements.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
It ignores robot motion.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
It likely fails.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Or none of the above.

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:28,000
You can check multiple boxes on the left.
