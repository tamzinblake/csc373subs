1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Question 2: consider the same world as before with 4 states.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:12,000
And now we're facing a situation in which there's 5 particles in A, 3 in B, 3 in C, and 1 in D.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
We will now take a motion step. So this is not about measurements, just motion.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Our robot moves with a 50% probability horizontally.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
So for example, if it was in D, it would move to C.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
It moves with a 50% chance vertically, but never diagonally,

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
and it never stays in the same cell.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:38,000
After 1 motion step, how many particles do we expect in cell A, B, C, and D?

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Answer the same for the asymptote.

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:47,000
So if we move infinitely often, what is the distribution that we expect this to converge to?

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
So I somewhat sloppily wrote "after infinite steps."

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
This is really what does it converge to in the end.
