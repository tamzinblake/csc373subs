00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Let's just go back to our example and see what an amazing thing you've just programmed.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
We had a uniform distribution over places.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Each place had a probability of 0.2.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
And then you wrote a piece of code that used the measurement to turn this prior

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
into a posterior, in which the probability of the 2 red cells was

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
a factor of 3 larger than the posterior of the green cells.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
You've done exactly what I gave you intuitively in the beginning as the secret of localization.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
You manipulated a probability distribution over places into a new one

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
by incorporating the measurement.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
In fact, let's go back to our code and test in your code whether we get a good result

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
when we replace our measurement red by green.

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
So please type green into your measurement variable and rerun your code

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
to see if you get the correct result.
