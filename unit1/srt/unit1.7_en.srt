1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
So let's look at the measurement of this robot in its world with 5 different grid cells,

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
x1 through x5.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Let's assume 2 of those cells are colored red whereas the other 3 are green.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
As before, we assign uniform probability to each cell of 0.2,

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
and our robot is now allowed to sense.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
And what it sees is a red color.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
How will this affect my belief over different places?

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Obviously, the ones for x2 and x3 should go up,

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
and the ones for x1, x4, and x5 should go down.

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
So I'm going now to tell you how to incorporate this measurement into our belief

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
with a very simple rule - a product.

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Any cell where the color is correct, any of the red cells,

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:00,000
we'll multiply it with a relatively large number, say 0.6.

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
That feels small, but as we'll see later, it's actually a large number.

15
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Whereas all the green cells will be multiplied with 0.2.

16
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Look at the ratio of those, and it seems about 3 times as likely

17
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
to be in a red cell than it is to be in a green cell,

18
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
because 0.6 is 3 times larger than 0.2.

19
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Now let's do the multiplication.

20
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
For each of those 5 cells, can you tell me what the result would be

21
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
multiplying in the measurement in the way I've stated?

22
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
So please, for these 5 boxes, fill out the number.
