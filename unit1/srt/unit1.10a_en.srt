1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
So one way to do this is to go explicitly through all these 5 different cases from 0 to 4

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
and multiply in manually the miss or hit case.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
This is not particularly elegant, but it does the job,

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
and as I hit the "Run" button, we get the correct answer that is not normalized.
