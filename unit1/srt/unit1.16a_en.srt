1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
And the answer is all of these are shifted to the right.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
So the 1/9 in the left-most cell comes over here, the 1/3 over here,

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
and finally the right-most 1/9 finds itself on the left side.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
In the case of exact motion, we have a perfect robot.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
We just shift the probabilities by the actual robot motion.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Now, that's a degenerate case. But it's a good one to program first, so let's program this one.
