00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
So before we're done with localization, I'd like to talk about robot motion.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Suppose we have a distribution over those cells,

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
such as this one: 1/9, 1/3, 1/3, 1/9, 1/9,

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
and even though we don't know where the robot is,

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
the robot moves, and it moves to the right.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
In fact, the way we're going to program is that we will assume the world is cyclic,

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:25,000
so it would drop off the right-most cell and find itself in the left-most cell.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Suppose we know for a fact the world moved exactly 1 grid cell to the right,

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
including the cyclic motion.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Can you tell me for all these 5 values, what the posterior probability is after that motion?
