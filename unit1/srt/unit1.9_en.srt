1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
To turn this back into a probability distribution,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
we will now divide each of these numbers by 0.36.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Put differently, we normalize.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:17,000
So please, in these 5 fields enter your result for dividing 0.04 or 0.12 by 0.36,

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
and please check that the sum of those truly adds up to 1.
