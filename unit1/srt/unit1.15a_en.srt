1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
And the modification is simple.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
We will call the procedure sense multiple times,

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
in fact, as often as we have measurements, which is the for loop over here,

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
we grab the kth measurement element and apply it to the current belief.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Then recursively update that belief into itself.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
In this case, we run it twice. We print the output.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
And for this specific example, we get back the uniform distribution.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
These are all '0.2's approximately.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
The reason is we up multiplied each field once for the 0.6

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
and down multiplied for the 0.2.

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
These are effects were in total the same for each cell.

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
And as a result, we get the same output over here. It's quite remarkable.
