1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
So let's look at motion, which will turn out to be something we will call total probability.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
You remember that we cared about a grid cell "xi",

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
and we asked what is the chance of being xi after robot motion?

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Now, to indicate the after and before, let me add a time index.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
So t, up here, is an index for time.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I write it superscript so there is no confusion with the index i, which is the grid cell.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
You might remember the way we computed this

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
was by looking at all the grid cells the robot could have come from 1 time step earlier,

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
indexed here by j,

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
we looked at the prior probability of those grid cells at time t - 1,

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:47,000
and we multiplied with the probability that our motion command would carry us from xj to xi.

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
That's written as a conditional distribution as follows.

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
So this was exactly what we implemented.

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
If there was our grid cells over here

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
and we asked one time step later about a specific grid cell over here,

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:05,000
we would combine 0.8 from over here, 0.1 from over here, and 0.1 from over here

17
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
into the probability of this grid cell.

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
It's the same formula as here.

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
This is now xi, and the way we find the posterior probability for xi is to go through

20
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
all possible places from which we could have come, all the different j's.

21
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Look at the prior probabilities, multiply it by the probability that I transition from j to i

22
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
given my motion command, which in this case is go 1 to the right side.

23
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Now in probability terms, people often write it as follows:

24
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
P(A) = sum of all B p(A│B) times p(B).

25
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
This is just the way you'd find it in text books,

26
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:45,000
and you can see directly the correspondence of A as a place i at time t

27
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
and all the different Bs as the possible prior locations.

28
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
That is often called the Theorem of Total Probability.

29
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:01,000
And the operation of a weighted sum over other variables is often called a "convolution".
