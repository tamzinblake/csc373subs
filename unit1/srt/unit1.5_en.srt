1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
So now in our Python interface, I'd like to take this code over here,

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
which assigns to p an empty list and modify it into code where p becomes

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:19,000
a uniform distribution over 5 grid cells as expressed in a vector of 5 probabilities.
