1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
And let's work this out.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:08,000
What I'm really asking is the probability of a fair coin "f" given that I observed H.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
This has nothing to do with total probability,

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
and all with Bayes Rules, because I'm talking about observations.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
The non-normalized probability according to Bayes Rule is obtained as follows:

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
The probability of observing H for the fair coin is 0.5,

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
and the probability of having grabbed the fair coin was 0.5 as well.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,000
The non-normalized probability of not F given H, which is the loaded coin,

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
is probability of H given not f,

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
which we know to be 0.1 - that's the one over here -

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
times the probability of not picking the fair coin, which is 0.5,

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
ends up to be 0.05.

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:55,000
When we now normalize, we α = 0.25 + 0.05, which is 0.3.

14
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:05,000
If we now normalize the 0.25 over here with the 0.3, we get 0.833,

15
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
which is the same as 5/6.

16
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
That's our posterior probability we hold the fair coin after we observed H.
