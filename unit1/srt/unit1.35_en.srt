Let me make a final quiz in which I have a coin whose probability I don't know.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
There are multiple coins. One is fair and one is loaded.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
The fair coin has a probability of heads of 0.5.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
The loaded coin has a probability of heads of 0.1.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Here's what I'm going to do. I'm going to grab a random coin with 50% chance.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
So the fair coin will be chosen with 50% chance,

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
and the loaded coin will be chosen with 50% chance,

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
but I don't know which one it is.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I flip it and I observe heads.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
What's the probability that the coin I hold in my hand is fair?

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Apply anything you've learned before.

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
One of the rules you've learned before is exactly the right one to apply here.
