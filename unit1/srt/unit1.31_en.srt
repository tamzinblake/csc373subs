00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Let's look into measurements, and they will lead to something called "Bayes Rule".

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
You might have heard about Bayes Rule before.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
It's the most fundamental consideration in probabilistic inference,

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
but the basic rule is really, really simple.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Suppose x is my grid cell and Z is my measurement.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Then the measurement update seeks to calculate a belief over my location

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
after seeing the measurement.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
How is this computed?

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Well, it was really easy to compute in our localization example.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
And now I'm going to make it a little bit more formal.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
It turns out Bayes Rule looks like this.

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
And that will likely be a little bit confusing,

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
but what it does is it takes my prior distribution, P(X),

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:53,000
and multiplies in the chances of seeing a red or green tile for every possible location

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
and out comes, if you just look at the numerator here,

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
the non-normalized posterior distribution we had before.

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Recognize this? This was our prior. This was our measurement probability.

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
If we do this for all the grid cells, so we put a little index "i" over here,

19
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:16,000
then just the product of the prior of the grid cell times the measurement probability,

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
which was large if the measurement corresponded to the correct color

21
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
and small if it corresponded to a false color.

22
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:29,000
That product gave us the non-normalized posterior distribution for the grid cell.

23
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
You remember this because that's what you programmed.

24
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
You programmed a product between the prior probability distribution and a number.

25
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
The normalization is now the constant over here, p(Z).

26
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Technically, that is the probability of seeing a measurement devoid of any location information.

27
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
But let's not confuse ourselves.

28
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
The easiest way to understand what's going on is to realize that

29
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,000
this is a function here that assigns to each grid cell a number,

30
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
and the p(Z) doesn't have the grid cell as an index.

31
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
So no matter what grid cell we consider, the p(Z) is the same.

32
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
And here's the trick.

33
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:15,000
No matter what p(Z) is, because the final posterior has to be a probability distribution,

34
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
by normalizing these non-normalized products over here,

35
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
we will exactly calculate p(Z).

36
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Put differently, p(Z) is the sum over all i of just this product over here.

37
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
So this makes Bayes Rule really simple.

38
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
It's a product of our prior distribution with a measurement probability,

39
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
which we know to be large if the color is correct and small otherwise.

40
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,000
We do this and assign it to a so-called non-normalized probability,

41
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
which I'll do with a little bar over the p.

42
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,000
And then I compute the normalizer, which I'll call "α," is the sum of all these guys over here.

43
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Then I just normalize.

44
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,000
My resulting probability will be 1/α of the non-normalized probability.

45
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,000
This is exactly what we did, and this is exactly Bayes Rule.
