1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
So let's talk about inaccurate robot motion.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
We are again given 5 grid cells.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:12,000
And let's assume a robot executes its action with high probability correctly, say 0.8,

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
but with 0.1 chance, it finds itself short of the intended action,

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
and yet another 0.1 probability it finds itself overshooting its target.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
You can define the same for other U values. Say U = 1.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Then with 0.8 chance it would end up over here,

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
0.1 it stays in the same element,

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
and 0.1 it hops 2 elements ahead.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Now this is a model of inaccurate robot motion.

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
This robot attempts to go U grid cells,

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
but occasionally falls short of its goal or overshoots.

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
And it's a more common case robots as they move accrue uncertainty,

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
and it's really important to model this, because this is the primary reason

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
why localization is hard, because robots are not very accurate

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
So we're now going to look into this first from the mathematical side.

17
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I will be giving you a prior distribution,

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
and we're going to be using the value of U = 2,

19
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
and for the motion model that shifts the robot exactly 2 steps,

20
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
we believe there is a 0.8 chance.

21
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:22,000
And we assign a 0.1 to the cases where the robot over or under shoots by exactly 1.

22
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:28,000
That's kind of written by this formula over here where the 2 gets a 0.8 probability,

23
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
the 1 and the 3 end up with a 0.1 probability.

24
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
So I'm going to ask you now for the initial distribution that I'm writing up here,

25
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
can you give me the distribution after the motion?
