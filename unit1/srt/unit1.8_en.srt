1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
And this is in principle our next belief.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
It only has one problem, which is it isn't a valid probability distribution.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
And the reason why is: probability distributions always have to add up to 1.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
So if I ask you what's the sum of all these values,

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
then we find out it doesn't add up to 1.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
So please type in the sum of all these values.
