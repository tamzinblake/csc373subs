00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
So let's move into our first programming exercise,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
and let's program together the very first version of robot localization.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
So here's a bit of program code, an empty list.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
And what I'd like you to program is a world with 5 different cells, or places,

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
where each cell has the same probability that the robot might be in that cell.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
So probabilities add up to 1.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Here's a simple quiz for the cells x1 all the way to x5.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
What is the probability of any of those x's?

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
So index i goes from 1 to 5.
