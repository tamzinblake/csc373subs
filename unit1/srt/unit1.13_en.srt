1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
So let's take that same piece of code

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
and modify it to give me a valid probability distribution.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Please modify this code so it normalizes the output of the function sense

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
so it add up to 1.
