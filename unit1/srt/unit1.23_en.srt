00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Now let's go back to our code and move many times.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Let's move twice, so please write a piece of code that makes the robot move twice,

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,000
starting with the initial distribution as shown over here: 0, 1, 0, 0, 0.
