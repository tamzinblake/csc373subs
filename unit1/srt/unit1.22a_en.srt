1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
And you might have guess it correctly. It's the uniform distribution.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
And there is an intuitive reasoning behind this.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Every time we move, we lose information.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
That is, in the initial distribution we know exactly where we are.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
One step in we have a 0.8 chance, but the 0.8 will fall to something smaller

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
as we move on - 0.64 and so on.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
The distribution of the absolute least information is the uniform distribution.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
It has no preference whatsoever.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
And that's really the result of moving many, many times.

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
There is a way to derive this mathematically,

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:41,000
and I can prove a property that's highly related, which is a balance property.

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Say we take x4, and we'd like to understand how x4 at some time sub t

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
corresponds to the previous time distribution over all these variables.

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
For this to be stationary, it has to be the same.

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Put differently, the probability of x4 must be the same as 0.8p(x2) + 0.1p(x1) + 0.1p(x3).

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
This is exactly the same calculation we did before where we asked

17
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
what's the chance of being x4.

18
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Well, you might be coming from x2, x1, or x3,

19
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
and as these probabilities, 0.8, 0.1, and 0.1,

20
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
they govern the likelihood you might have been coming from there.

21
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Those together must hold true in the limit when things don't move anymore.

22
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Now, you might think there's many different ways to solve this

23
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
and the 0.2 is just one solution,

24
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
but it turns out 0.2 is the only solution.

25
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
So if you plug in 0.2 over here, 0.2 over here, 0.2 over here,

26
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
you get 1 times 0.2, and that's 0.2 on the right side.

27
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,000
So clearly, those '0.2's over here meet the balance that is necessary

28
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
to define a valid solution in the limit.
