1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Let's pick a different place.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Let's assume the robot saw red twice.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
So it senses red, it moves, it senses red, it moves again.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
What is the most likely cell?
