1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Let's run the program, and we'll find that the most likely cell is the 4th cell.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
And that makes sense, because the best match of red, red to the world

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
is red over here, red over here.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
And after seeing the 2nd red, the robot still moved 1 to the right

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
and finds itself in the 4th cell as shown over here.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Now I want to celebrate with you the code that you just wrote,

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
which is a piece of software that implements

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
the essence of Google's self-driving car's localization approach.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
As I said in the beginning, it's absolutely crucial that the car knows

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
exactly where it is relative to the map of its road.

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:45,000
And while the road isn't painted green and red, the road has lane markers.

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
And instead of those green and red cells over here,

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
we plug in the color of the lane markings relative to the color of the pavement.

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
It isn't just one observation per time step, it's an entire field of observations,

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
an entire camera image,

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
but you can do the same with a camera image

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
as long as you can correspond a camera image in your model

18
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
with a camera image in your measurements.

19
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
And then a piece of code not much more difficult than what you coded yourself

20
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
is responsible for localizing the Google self-driving car.

21
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:26,000
So you just implemented a major, major function that makes Google's car drive itself.

22
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
So I think you should be really happy and proud of yourself.

23
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
And you should say to yourself, I just implemented localization.

24
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Now why on earth did it take Google that long to build a product that drives itself?

25
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Well, the truth is the situation is a little more difficult.

26
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Sometimes roads get paved over and changed, and we're working on this.

27
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:54,000
But what you've implemented is the core of Google's self-driving car localization idea.

28
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Let me just summarize the essential things we've learned.
