00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
So I'm now replacing the red by green over here,

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
and I rerun my code and out come these funny numbers.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Which is, somewhere in there is the division by 44,

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
but you can see that the 1st, the 4th, and the 5th grid cell have a much larger value

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
than the grid cells in the middle.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
So let's dive in.
