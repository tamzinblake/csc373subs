00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
And here are the three lines of code I used to program this in.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
First I computed the sum of a vector Q using the function sum,

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
which makes it really easy.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
And then I go through all the elements in Q and just divide it by s,

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:19,000
which is the normalization, and when I run it, I get 1/9, 1/3, 1/3, 1/9, and 1/9.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
So I've just implemented the absolute key function of localization,

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
which is called the measurement update.
