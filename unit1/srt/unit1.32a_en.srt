1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
And the answer is, 0.0079.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
In other words, there is only a 0.79 percent chance,

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
0.79 out of 100,

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
that despite the positive test result, that you have cancer.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
And we're going to apply the exact same mechanics as we did before.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
The result of Bayes Rule, non-normalized, of c given pos,

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
is simply the product of my prior probability, 0.01,

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
times 0.8, which is the probability of

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
a positive result in the cancer state.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
And that ends up to be 0.0008.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
The non-normalized probability for the opposite event,

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
the non-cancerous event, given a positive test, is 0.999

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,000
times 0.1, and that is obviously 0.0999.

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Our normalizer, and so the sum of both of those,

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,000
which is 0.1007, just add these 2 values up over here.

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
So dividing 0.0008, the non-normalized probability,

17
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:14,000
by 0.1007, gives us 0.079.

18
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
We just applied Bayes Rule to compute a really involved probability

18
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
of having cancer after seeing a test result.
