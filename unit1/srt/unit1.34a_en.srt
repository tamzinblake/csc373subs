1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
And the answer is 1/4. It's easy to see that the probability of heads in step 2

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
is the probability of heads in step 2 conditioned on heads in step 1

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
times probability of heads in 1,

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,000
plus, that's the sum, probability of heads in step 2

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,000
given we had tails in step 1 times probability of tails in step 1.

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
And now, the way I set it up, those things here are equally likely.

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
However, if we did have tails in step 1,

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
we would never toss the coin again and just accept it.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,000
So it's impossible that in step 2 I flip over to heads. It's probability zero.

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Whereas if I found heads, I would flip again and then the 0.5 chance I arrive at heads.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
If I look at this, then this all becomes zero,

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
and these guys multiply to 1/4, and the final answer is 1/4.
