I define a function "move" with an input distribution p and a motion number "U",

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
where U is the number of grid cells that the robot is moving to the right or to the left.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
And I want you to program a function that returns the new distribution Q after the move

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
where if U equals zero, Q is the same as p.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
If U equals 1, all the values are cyclically shifted to the right by 1.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
If U equals 3, they are cyclically shifted to the right by 3.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
If U equals -1, they're cyclically shifted to the left.

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
So please call the function with argument p and a shift to the right by 1.

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I've commented out my measurement part because for now

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I don't want to do measurement updates.

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
In addition to this, I will use a very simple p,

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
that has a 1 at the second position and zeros elsewhere.

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Otherwise, if we were to use the uniform p,

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
we couldn't even see the effect of the motion

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
whether that's programmed correctly or not.
