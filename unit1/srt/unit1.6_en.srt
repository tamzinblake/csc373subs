1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Let's see if we can modify this to make a vector of length n

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,000
where I can vary the value of n and get a resulting vector with n elements.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
So for n equals 5, we'd get the same result as before,

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
but for n equals 10, I should get a vector of length 10,

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
each of which would have a value of 0.1.
