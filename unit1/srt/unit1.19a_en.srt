1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
And this is a pretty tricky question, which I'm going to answer in two phases.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Let's just look at the 0.5 over here, 0.8 of that, which is 0.4, ends up over here,

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,000
and 0.1 of this, which is 0.05 ends up over here.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:23,000
And the reason why I write it so small is because this is not the correct answer quite yet.

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Let's look at the other 0.5.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
0.4 goes two steps - 1, 2, ends up over here on the left side,

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:38,000
but 0.1 falls short, makes the 0.5 over here, 0.05 in the second grid cell.

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
And interestingly enough, for the cell on the right side,

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
there's two possible ways you could've gotten there.

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Either by overshooting starting in the second cell,

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
or undershooting starting in the right cell.

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
So the total probability over here is the sum of these two things, 0.1.

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:03,000
So this is the final answer: 0.4, 0.05, 0.05, 0.4, and 0.1.
