Let me test total probability in a quiz.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Suppose I flip a coin, and the coin comes up tails or heads.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
And suppose it's a fair coin.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
So the probability of tails or of heads is both 1/2.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Now let's say that the coin comes up tails, and I just accept and don't do anything.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
But suppose it comes up heads, and I flip it again,

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
and after 1 flip, I accept the result.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
So my quiz for you is: what is the probability that the final result is heads?

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
And that's an example of total probability.
