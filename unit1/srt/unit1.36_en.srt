1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
All right. With this I'd like to finish this class.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
I just want to tell you what you've learned, because you did amazingly well.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
You learned about localization.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
You wrote an algorithm that implements what's called Markov localization.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
You learned about probabilities, Bayes Rule, and total probability.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
You implemented all of this, and you solved interesting quiz questions.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
This is an enormous amount of work.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
You are now able to make a robot localize,

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
but you also have a very intuitive understanding of some very interesting

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
and important probabilistic methods that are commonly called "filters".

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
So next class, we're going to see new filters,

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
and particularly, we're going to talk about particle filters and Kalman filters.

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:49,000
And we will apply both of those to really interesting problems in the Google self-driving car,

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:55,000
in particular, to the problem of finding and predicting other cars.

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'll see you in the next class.
