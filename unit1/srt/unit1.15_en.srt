1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
In fact, I'd like you to modify this code a little bit more

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
in a way that we have multiple measurements.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
So instead of Z, we're going to make a measurement vector called "measurements".

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
And we're going to assume that we're going to first sense red and then green.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Can you modify the code that so it updates the probability twice

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
and gives me the posterior after both of these measurements are incorporated?

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
In fact, can you modify it in a way

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
that any sequence of measurements can be processed, of any length?
