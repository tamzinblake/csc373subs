1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
We learned that localization maintains a function over all

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
possible places where a road might be,

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
where each cell has an associated probability value.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,000
The measurement update function, or "sense", is nothing else but a product

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
in which we take those probability values and multiply them up or down

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
depending on the exact measurement.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Because the product might violate the fact that probabilities add up to 1,

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
there was a product followed by normalization.

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Motion was a convolution.

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
And this word itself might sound cryptic, but what it really meant is

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:41,000
for each possible location after the motion, we reverse engineered the situation

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
and guessed where in the world it might have come from

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
and then collected, we added, the corresponding probabilities.

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,000
So something as simple as multiplication and addition solves all of localization

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
and is the foundation for autonomous driving.

16
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I want to spend a few minutes and go over the formal definition of localization.

17
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
And I'm going to introduce probability and ask you lots of questions.
