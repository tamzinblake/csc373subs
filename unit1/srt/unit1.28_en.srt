00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Formally, we define a probability function to be P(X),

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
and it's a value that is bounded below and above by 0 and 1.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
X often can take multiple values.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
We had the case of 5 grid cells.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Suppose it can only take 2 values - there's only 2 grid cells, x1 and x2.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
If the probability for x1 is 0.2, what would be the probability for x2?

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
So please enter the number. It's a quiz, obviously.
