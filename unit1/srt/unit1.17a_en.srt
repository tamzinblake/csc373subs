1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
And here is the solution.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
We start with the empty list. We go through all the elements in p.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
And this is the tricky line.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,000
We will construct Q element-by-element by accessing the corresponding p,

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:21,000
and p is shifted by U and if this shift exceeds the range of p on the left,

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
we apply the modal operator with the number of states as an argument.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
In this case, it'll be 5.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Now, the reason why there is a minus sign is tricky.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
To shift the distribution to the right, U = 1,

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
we need to find in p the element 1 place to the left.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
So rather than shifting p to the right directly,

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
what I've done is I've constructed q by searching for

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
where the robot might have come from.

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
And that's of course, in hindsight, from the left.

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Therefore, there is a minus sign over here.

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
So think about this; this is a little bit nontrivial,

17
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
but it's going to be important as we go forward and define

18
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
probabilistic convolution and generalize this to the noisy case.
