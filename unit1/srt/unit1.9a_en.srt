1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
So 0.12 divided by 0.36 is the same as 12 divided by 36 is the same as a third or 0.333.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
And 0.04 divided by 36 is the same as 4 divided by 36,

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
that is 1/9.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:25,000
And if you look at these numbers, 1/3, there's 1/3 plus 3/9 is another 1/3 gives exactly 1.

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
So this is a probability distribution, which is often written in the following way:

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
The probability of each cell, i where i could range from 1-5,

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,000
after we've seen our measurement Z.

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:48,000
The probabilist would also call it posterior distribution of place xi given measurement Z.

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
So let's implement all this.
