1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
And here's one way to implement this.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
We're going to introduce the auxiliary variable "s",

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
which we build up in three different steps.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:15,000
We multiply the p value as before for the exact, set off by pExact.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Then we add to it two more multiplied by pOvershot or pUndershot

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
where we are overshooting by going yet 1 step further than U

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
or undershooting by cutting it short by 1.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
And then we add these things up and finally append the sum of those

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
to our probability q.

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:42,000
When we run this, we get for our example prior of 0, 1, 0, 0, 0,

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
the answer 0, 0.1, 0.8, 0.1, and 0.
