1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
So here's our initial distribution again.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Here's our factor for getting the color right or for getting it wrong,

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
and let's first start with the non-normalized version.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Write a piece of code that outputs p after multiplying in pHit and pMiss

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
at the corresponding places.
