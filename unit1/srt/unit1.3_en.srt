1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Let me begin my story in a world where a robot resides.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
And let's assume the robot has no clue where it is.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Then we will model this with a function I'm going to draw into this diagram over here

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
where the vertical axis is the probability for any location in this world,

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
and the horizontal axis corresponds to all the places in this 1-dimensional world.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
The way I'm going to model the robot's current belief about where it might be,

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
its confusion, is by a uniform function that assigns equal weight

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
to every possible place in this world.

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
That is the state of maximum confusion.

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Now, to localize, the world has to have some distinctive features.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Let's assume there are 3 different landmarks in the world.

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:55,000
There is a door over here, there's a door over here, and a 3rd one way back here.

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
And for the sake of the argument,

14
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
let's assume they all look alike, so they're not indistinguishable,

15
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
but you can distinguish the door from the non-door area, from the wall.

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Now let's see how the robot can localize itself by assuming it senses,

17
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
and it senses that it's standing right next to a door.

18
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
So all it knows now is that it is located, likely, next to a door.

19
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
How will this affect our belief?

20
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Here is the critical step for localization.

21
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
If you understand this step, you understand localization.

22
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
The measurement of a door transforms our belief function,

23
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
defined over possible locations, to a new function that looks pretty much like this.

24
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:42,000
For the 3 locations adjacent to doors, we now have an increased belief of being there

25
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
whereas all the other locations have a decreased belief.

26
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
This is a probability distribution that assigns higher probability for being next to a door,

27
00:01:51,000 --> 00:02:00,000
and it's called the posterior belief where the word "posterior" means it's after a measurement has been taken.

28
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Now, the key aspect of this belief is that we still don't know where we are.

29
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
There are 3 possible door locations, and in fact, it might be

30
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
that the sensors were erroneous, and we accidentally saw a door where there is none.

31
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,000
So there is still a residual probability of being in these places over here,

32
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:22,000
but these three bumps together really express our current best belief of where we are.

33
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:29,000
This representation is absolutely core to probability and to mobile robot localization.

34
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Now let's assume the robot moves.

35
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Say it moves to the right by a certain distance.

36
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Then we can shift the belief according to the motion.

37
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
And the way this might look like is about like this.

38
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
So this bump over here made it to here.

39
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
This guy went over here, and this guy over here.

40
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Obviously, this robot knows its heading direction.

41
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
It's moving to the right in this example,

42
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
and it knows roughly how far it moved.

43
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Now, robot motion is somewhat uncertain.

44
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
We can never be certain where the robot moved.

45
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
So these things are a little bit flatter than these guys over here.

46
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,000
The process of moving those bleeps to the right side is technically called a convolution.

47
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
And let's now assume the robot senses again, and for the sake of the argument,

48
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
let's assume it sees itself right next to a door again,

49
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
so the measurement is the same as before.

50
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Now the most amazing thing happens.

51
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,000
We end up multiplying our belief, which is now prior to the second measurement,

52
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
with a function that looks very much like this one over here,

53
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,000
which has a peak at each door and out comes a belief that looks like the following.

54
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:42,000
There's a couple of minor bumps, but the only really big bump is this one over here.

55
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:48,000
This one corresponds to this guy over there in the prior,

56
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,000
and it's the only place in this prior that really corresponds to the measurement of a door,

57
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
whereas all the other places of doors have a low prior belief.

58
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
So as a result, this function is really interesting.

59
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
It's a distribution that focuses most of its weight

60
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
onto the correct hypothesis of the world being in the second door,

61
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:12,000
and it provides very little belief to places far away from doors.

62
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
At this point, our robot has localized itself.

63
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,000
If you understood this, you understand probability, and you understand localization.

64
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:26,000
So congratulations. You understand probability and localization.

65
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
You might not know yet, but that's really a core aspect of understanding

66
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
a whole bunch of things I'm going to teach you in the class today.
