1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
So let me ask you Bayes Rule in the context of a completely different example

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
to see if you understand how to apply Bayes Rule.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
This time it's about cancer testing.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
And it's an example that is commonly studied in statistics classes.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Suppose there exists a certain type of cancer,

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
but the cancer is rare; only 1 in a 1000 people has the cancer,

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
whereas 999 in 1000 people don't have it,

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
illustrated by the probability of cancer and the probability of not cancer.

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Suppose we have a test, and the test can come out positive or negative.

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
The probability that the test triggers positive if I have cancer is 0.8,

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,000
and the probability that the test comes out positive given that I'm cancer free is only 0.1.

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
So clearly the test has a strong correlation to whether I have cancer.

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Here's a really difficult question.

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Can you compute for me the probability of cancer given that I just received a positive test.

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Let me emphasize this is not an easy question, but you should be able,

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
based on what I've taught you, to calculate this result.

17
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Think of the cancer/non cancer as the robot position

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:13,000
and think of the positive as whether the colored door observed is the correct one.
