1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Let's assume we have a 0.5 in this cell and a 0.5 in this cell.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
And remember that this is a cyclic-motion model,

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
so whatever falls off on the right side, you'll find on the left side.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Can you again for U = 2 fill in the posterior distribution?
