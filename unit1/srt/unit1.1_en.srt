00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
So, welcome to Artificial Intelligence for Robotics.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
You are entering an exciting 7-week class

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
in which you'll learn how to program self-driving cars.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
And just to motivate what we're trying to achieve in this class,

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
let me show you some videos.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:25,000
So, my interest in self-driving cars started with the DARPA Grand Challenge in 2004,

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
in which my team at Stanford developed Stanley,

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
a robot that could drive itself through the Mojave Desert.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
The vehicle was based on a Volkswagen Touareg

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
that was equipped with all kinds of sensors like GPS and laser,

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
and it was able to make its own decisions without any human input whatsoever.

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
The DARPA Grand Challenge was a government-sponsored race

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
that took place in 2005.

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Here we see our robot Stanley moving through the desert

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
completely without a human on board.

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
The task was to drive a desert trail for about 130 miles,

17
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
and whoever was fastest would win the race.

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Here we're passing a different robot by Carnegie Mellon University

19
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
at about 110 miles into the race.

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Our robot was able to navigate really steep mountainous roads

21
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
and able to avoid collisions with rocks or falling down a cliff

22
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
all based on its ability to use what I'm going to teach you in this class.

23
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:29,000
After almost 7 hours and 131 miles our robot returned all the way to the starting base

24
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
as the first robot to ever finish a DARPA Grand Challenge,

25
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
winning Stanford University 2 million bucks

26
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,000
and Stanley a place in the Smithsonian Museum of American History.

27
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
This work led to the Urban Challenge, in which we built another robot called Junior

28
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
that eventually took second place.

29
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
The Urban Challenge was a followup race by DARPA

30
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
in which cars were asked to drive in traffic,

31
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
so whereas the Grand Challenge was kind of a motionless desert floor,

32
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,000
this was a mock urban city where the robot was able to interact with other traffic

33
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
and had to follow traffic rules as in this left turn over here.

34
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
It had to be stay on lanes with very high precision,

35
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,000
accommodate oncoming traffic and just drive confidently

36
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
in a situation that really resembled a small city.

37
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
This led at Google to a sequence of experiments

38
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
known as the Google self-driving car,

39
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
and I believe these are the best robotic cars out there today.

40
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Here we see one of our Priuses on University Avenue in Palo Alto

41
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
kind of undetected driving just like a human driver,

42
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
but this car is driving by itself.

43
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Our cars have been able to drive hundreds of thousands of miles

44
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
all across California and some of Nevada,

45
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:53,000
in downtown areas like San Francisco, on busy highways.

46
00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Here in Monterrey, a small coastal city in California with lots and lots of pedestrians.

47
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:06,000
And these are all completely self-driven moments where the car is able to accommodate

48
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
things like deer in the headlights in the middle of the night

49
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:16,000
or even crooked Lombard Street in San Francisco as shown in this video.

50
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
This is what I'm doing on my day job.

51
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I really love, with my team, building self-driving cars.

52
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
We believe it's going to really change the world,

53
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,000
and in this class that's what I hope to enable you to do.

54
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
So let's dive in.
