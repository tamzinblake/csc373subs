00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
So here's a question for you that is somewhat involved,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
and I really want to check your intuition.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Suppose we have 5 grid cells as before

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,000
with an initial distribution that assigns 1 to the first grid cell and 0 to all of the other ones.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Let's assume we do U = 1, which means with 0.8 chance

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
in each action we transition 1 to the right.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
With 0.1 chance we don't move at all,

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
and with 0.1 chance again we skip and move 2 steps.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
And again, let's assume the world is cyclic,

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
so every time I fall off on the right side, I find myself back on the left side.

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
The question is: suppose I run infinitely many motion steps.

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Then I actually get a, what's called a "limit distribution"

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
So what's going to happen to my robot if it never senses but executes the action

14
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:53,000
go 1 to the right on our little cyclic environment forever?

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:00,000
What will be the so-called limit or stationary distribution be in the very end?
