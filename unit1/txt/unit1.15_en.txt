In fact, I'd like you to modify this code a little bit more in a way that we have multiple measurements.

So instead of Z, we're going to make a measurement vector called "measurements". And we're going to assume that we're going to first sense red and then green.

Can you modify the code that so it updates the probability twice and gives me the posterior after both of these measurements are incorporated?

In fact, can you modify it in a way that any sequence of measurements can be processed, of any length?
