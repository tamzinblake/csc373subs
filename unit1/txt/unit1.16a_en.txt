And the answer is all of these are shifted to the right.

So the 1/9 in the left-most cell comes over here, the 1/3 over here, and finally the right-most 1/9 finds itself on the left side. In the case of exact motion, we have a perfect robot.

We just shift the probabilities by the actual robot motion. Now, that's a degenerate case. But it's a good one to program first, so let's program this one.
