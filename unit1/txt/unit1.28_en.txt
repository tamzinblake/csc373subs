Formally, we define a probability function to be P(X), and it's a value that is bounded below and above by 0 and 1. X often can take multiple values.

We had the case of 5 grid cells.

Suppose it can only take 2 values - there's only 2 grid cells, x1 and x2. If the probability for x1 is 0.2, what would be the probability for x2?

So please enter the number. It's a quiz, obviously.
