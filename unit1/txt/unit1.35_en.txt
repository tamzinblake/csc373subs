Let me make a final quiz in which I have a coin whose probability I don't know.
There are multiple coins. One is fair and one is loaded. The fair coin has a probability of heads of 0.5. The loaded coin has a probability of heads of 0.1.

Here's what I'm going to do. I'm going to grab a random coin with 50% chance. So the fair coin will be chosen with 50% chance, and the loaded coin will be chosen with 50% chance, but I don't know which one it is.

I flip it and I observe heads. What's the probability that the coin I hold in my hand is fair?

Apply anything you've learned before. One of the rules you've learned before is exactly the right one to apply here.
