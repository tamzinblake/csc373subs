And here's one way to implement this.

We're going to introduce the auxiliary variable "s", which we build up in three different steps.

We multiply the p value as before for the exact, set off by pExact. Then we add to it two more multiplied by pOvershot or pUndershot where we are overshooting by going yet 1 step further than U or undershooting by cutting it short by 1.

And then we add these things up and finally append the sum of those to our probability q.

When we run this, we get for our example prior of 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, the answer 0, 0.1, 0.8, 0.1, and 0.
