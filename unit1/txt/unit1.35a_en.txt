And let's work this out.

What I'm really asking is the probability of a fair coin "f" given that I observed H. This has nothing to do with total probability, and all with Bayes Rules, because I'm talking about observations.

The non-normalized probability according to Bayes Rule is obtained as follows: The probability of observing H for the fair coin is 0.5, and the probability of having grabbed the fair coin was 0.5 as well. The non-normalized probability of not F given H, which is the loaded coin, is probability of H given not f, which we know to be 0.1 - that's the one over here - times the probability of not picking the fair coin, which is 0.5, ends up to be 0.05.

When we now normalize, we Î± = 0.25 + 0.05, which is 0.3.

If we now normalize the 0.25 over here with the 0.3, we get 0.833, which is the same as 5/6.

That's our posterior probability we hold the fair coin after we observed H.
