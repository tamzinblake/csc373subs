So let's move into our first programming exercise, and let's program together the very first version of robot localization.

So here's a bit of program code, an empty list. And what I'd like you to program is a world with 5 different cells, or places, where each cell has the same probability that the robot might be in that cell.

So probabilities add up to 1.

Here's a simple quiz for the cells x1 all the way to x5.

What is the probability of any of those x's?
So index i goes from 1 to 5.
