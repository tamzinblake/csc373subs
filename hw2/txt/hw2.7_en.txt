So congratulations!

You just made it through the Kalman filter class and the second homework assignment. You've implemented Kalman filters, you learned a lot about Gaussians, and you wrote your first vehicle tracking software.

Congratulations, that's actually really, really cool.

Next week, we'll talk about particle filters as yet another method for state estimation. It is very interesting and very fascinating. We're going to implement our first.

See you next week in class.
