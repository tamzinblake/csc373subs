I have another Gaussian question for you.

This is called a heavy-tail Gaussian. So, as you go to +/- infinity, the Gaussian levels off at some finite value α, as opposed to 0.

My question is:

Is it possible to represent this function as a Gaussian?

This is the formula for the Gaussian again. Put differently, can you find a μ and a σ² for which this exact function over here is obtained?

Please just check one of these two boxes.
