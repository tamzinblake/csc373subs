00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,950
Say we have a prior of a Gaussian with mean μ and covariance σ²,

2
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:12,949
and our measurement has exactly the same mean and the same covariance.

3
00:00:12,949 --> 00:00:18,449
Suppose we multiply both and get a new mean, which is the same as the old mean,

4
00:00:18,449 --> 00:00:23,000
and we get a new covarience, σ²,

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
which as you all know, corresponds to a peakier Gaussian.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,750
I want you to express ν² as a multiple of σ².

7
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:36,000
Just put your answer here as a real number.
