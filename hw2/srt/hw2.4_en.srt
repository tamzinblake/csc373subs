00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
My next question pertains to the tracking problem that we talked about in class.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:13,000
In class we addressed a 1-dimensional tracking problem where we were estimating the location of the system and its velocity (x dot).

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I'd like now to generalize this to a 2-dimensional problem,

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
where we're given a coordinate x and y,

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
and the object we're tracking moves in 2-dimensional space,

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:30,000
and we wish to use a Kalman filter to understand where the object is, what its velocity is,

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:38,000
and to even able to predict a future location based on the estimate of the position and its velocity.

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,000
So the only difference to class, is that our object now moves in a 2-dimensional space,

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
whereas in class it moved in a 1-dimensional space.

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:53,000
So my first question is:  What's the dimension of the state vector in the Kalman filter?

11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
In the class, it was this kind of state vector. Now, we have a new one.

12
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
How many dimensions or how many variables are there?
