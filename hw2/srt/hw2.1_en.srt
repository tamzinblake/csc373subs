00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
This is homework assignment #2 in CS 373,

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
and it's all about Kalman filters.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
So question #1 is measurement update.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Let's start with 2 Gaussians and say they have identical variances. Let's multiply them.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,000
We know that the resulting Gaussian mean will be just at the center between those 2 Gaussians.

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I wonder if the new variance σ² is now smaller, larger, or the same as either of the individual Gaussian.

7
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Please check one of the three.
