00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Now comes the tricky question. In the Kalman filter program that we studied,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
the 2-D Kalman filter, we had a matrix F.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:15,000
And for delta T equals 0.1, our F matrix, the state transition matrix,

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,000
had a main diagonal of 1, which means in expectation our location stays the same

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
and our velocity stays the same. And we also knew

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
that the velocity affected our state in the following way.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
And you could now place 0.1 instead of the delta T

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
to get this specific F matrix.

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Now I want to know from you for this new 2-D case with a 4-dimensional state vector

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:48,000
what is the new F? It is a 4 by 4 matrix, so I want you to fill in

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:55,000
all of those values. Again please assume that delta T equals 0.1,

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
and don't write delta T, write 0.1.
