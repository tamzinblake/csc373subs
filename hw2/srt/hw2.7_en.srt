1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
So congratulations!

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
You just made it through the Kalman filter class and the second homework assignment.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
You've implemented Kalman filters,

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
you learned a lot about Gaussians,

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
and you wrote your first vehicle tracking software.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Congratulations, that's actually really, really cool.

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Next week, we'll talk about particle filters as yet another method for state estimation.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
It is very interesting and very fascinating.

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
We're going to implement our first. See you next week in class.
