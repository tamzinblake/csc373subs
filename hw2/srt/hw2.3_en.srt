I have another Gaussian question for you.

2
00:00:02,299 --> 00:00:04,969
This is called a heavy-tail Gaussian.

3
00:00:04,969 --> 00:00:08,439
So, as you go to +/- infinity,

4
00:00:08,439 --> 00:00:11,649
the Gaussian levels off at some finite value α,

5
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:13,550
as opposed to 0.

6
00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:15,050
My question is:

7
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:23,890
Is it possible to represent this function as a Gaussian?

8
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:26,960
This is the formula for the Gaussian again.

9
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:33,870
Put differently, can you find a μ and a σ²

10
00:00:33,869 --> 00:00:36,000
for which this exact function over here is obtained?

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Please just check one of these two boxes.
