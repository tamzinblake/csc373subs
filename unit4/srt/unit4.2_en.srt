00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Suppose we live in a discrete world like this, and this is a world we'll be programming.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Let's for simplicity assume that the world is divided into little grid cells.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Our initial location is over here facing north, or up.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
This is the vehicle and the little arrow over here indicates where it's facing.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
I'll call this "Start".

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
And we wish to get to this area over here, presumably facing to the left side.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Let's assume at each time step I can either move forward or I can turn the vehicle.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm going to call these actions.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
And each of those costs me exactly 1 unit of cost.

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Then what's the total cost I have to endure to move from start to goal?

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
This is a number. Please put a number in here.
