Let me look at a different maze, and this is not a car example anymore,

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
but it's close to what we're going to program.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Suppose we start over here, and our goal is to go into this corner over here.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
And there's multiple blocked cells along the way.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:26,000
And in this case, we have a robot that can go up, down, left, or right.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
How many steps does it take for the robot that starts over here

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
to reach the goal position?

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Please enter your number over here.
