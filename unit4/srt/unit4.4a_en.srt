1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
And this was a tricky question.  This was a tricky question, it's 15, turns out.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
The path stays the same. I haven't punished left turns enough. Let me just try this.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
If I were to go forward, forward, forward, left, forward, forward,

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:21,000
we accrue a total cost of 1, 2, 3, 13, 14, 15.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
You can arrive at the same 15 by taking the 6 steps it takes to the goal

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
and add the extra 9 penalty it takes just for the turn itself,

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
which is 10 minus 1, and you get 15.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Let me look at the possible other path, which would take the loop over here

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:46,000
and avoid the left turn altogether--1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16.

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
So the path around this loop over here has a cost of 16, which is more than 15.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
We still prefer the left turn.
