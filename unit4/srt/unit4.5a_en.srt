1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
And the answer is 16.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Now we're going to take the loop over here:

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:11,000
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10,11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,000
With a cost of left turns this high, the left turn over here becomes prohibitively expensive,

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
and we'd rather take a detour on the right side

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
and do 3 right turns as opposed to 1 left turn.
