1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
So let's look at the path planning problem as a search problem.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
If you took my AI online class, you know what this is all about,

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
but I want to make sure that everybody can understand what I'm talking about.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
So let's start with a little grid world of size 6 by 5

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:22,000
where our start location is in the top left corner, our goal in the bottom right corner.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
And I block off a few cells so there is still a safe path to the goal.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
So this could be a search through a city graph, through a parking lot,

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
or through a maze of streets for a mobile robot.

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
And just for simplicity, in this example let's assume the robot is given 4 actions.

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
It can go up, down, left, or right.

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
And also for simplicity, let's assume that every action succeeds with absolute certainty.

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
We don't model uncertainty in this example.

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:00,000
The path planning or search problem is to find the shortest sequence of actions

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
that leads our robot from the start state to the goal state.

15
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
And just to check, tell me how many you think these are.

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
How many action are required to go from start to goal?
