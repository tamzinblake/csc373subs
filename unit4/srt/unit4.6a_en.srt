1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
And the answer is 7.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,000
As you can see, the shortest path will lead along here.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Then it becomes ambiguous. We could either go right or up.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Let's say we randomly go up and hit the goal,

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
so 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 steps to the goal.
