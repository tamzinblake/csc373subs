1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Now, the reason why I change the actions this way is for my next quiz.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Suppose we punish left turns. Why would we do this?

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Well, in real traffic, left turns are harder to do than the right turns.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Often you have to wait for oncoming traffic.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Let's say in our planning, left turns are more expensive.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
In fact, I should mention that parcel delivery services

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
that plan for optimal routes of trucks like FedEx and UPS in the States,

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
they actually plan routes that try to avoid left turns during rush hours,

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
because it just takes much longer to do left turns.

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
If they can go right turns, they prefer those.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
In this example here, let's now say that forward motion costs you 1.

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
A left turn costs you 10, and a right turn costs you 1.

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Now, what is the optimal path, and specifically what's the cost of the optimal path?
