1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
And the answer is 6. We apply this action over here 3 times: 1, 2, 3.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
We're at this section over here.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Now we apply the left turn and go forward action, which is the center action over here.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
We end facing over here. That's the fourth. Then we go straight again twice.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
This action over here, 5 and 6.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:23,000
So we get a total of 6, as opposed to 7 when we counted the turning separately.
