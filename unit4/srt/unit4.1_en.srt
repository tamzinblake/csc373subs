00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Let's talk about motion planning.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
The fundamental problem in motion planning is that a robot might live in a world like this,

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
and it might want to find its way to a goal like this

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
and has to devise a plan to get there.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
This same problem occurs for a self-driving car

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,000
that might live in a city near a highway on the network of streets.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:34,000
It has to find its way around and navigate to its target location.

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
If we zoom in and look at this intersection -

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
and this is my best rendering of a street-light environment -

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
we have also planning problems here.

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Picture a car coming from here that wishes to go over here.

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
To take a left turn on this intersection over here,

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
this car would have to turn right first,

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
engage in a lane shift and then take the left turn to the goal location.

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Now, a lane shift over here is a risky proposition.

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
If there's a bit truck parked over here,

17
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
the space might be insufficient to carry out the lane shift.

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:15,000
So an alternative plan might be to go straight over here, take the detour around the block,

19
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
and then go straight to the target location.

20
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
The process of finding a path from a start location to a goal location

21
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
is called "planning."

22
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
And for robots, it's often called "robot motion planning".

23
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
So today I'm going to talk about discrete methods for planning

24
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
in which the world chopped into small bins.

25
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,000
In the next class we're going to talk about continuous motion using those plans.

26
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
So what's the planning problem? We're given a map of the world.

27
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
We're given a starting location.

28
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
We're given a goal location.

29
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
And usually, we're given some sort of a cost function.

30
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
And the simplest way to think of cost is just the time it takes to drive a certain route.

31
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
And the goal is: find the minimum cost path.

32
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
So before we program anything, let me see if I can ask you a couple of questions

33
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
for minimum cost paths.
