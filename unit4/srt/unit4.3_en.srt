1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Let me now change the action model into a different model.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
We have 3 actions. Here is the first. I can go just forward.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
The second one is I can turn left and then go forward.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
And the third one is I can turn right and then go forward.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
So in all of these actions, I take a step forward.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
In the left one, I don't turn at all.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
The center one over here I turn left and go forward.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
This one over here I turn right and go forward.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Let's say for the time being the cost of each of those is 1.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
What is now the total cost of the optimal path to the goal?
