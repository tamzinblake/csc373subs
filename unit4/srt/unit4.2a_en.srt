00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
The answer I want to see is 7 and not 6.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
The reason why I want to see 7 is it takes 6 steps to go on the shortest path to the goal:

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
But in this cell over here I have to turn to the left side.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
And that turn also costs me a unit of 1.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:26,000
So that's in total 6 straight motions and 1 turn, gives me 7.
