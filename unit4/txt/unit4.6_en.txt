Let me look at a different maze, and this is not a car example anymore, but it's close to what we're going to program.

Suppose we start over here, and our goal is to go into this corner over here. And there's multiple blocked cells along the way. And in this case, we have a robot that can go up, down, left, or right. How many steps does it take for the robot that starts over here to reach the goal position?

Please enter your number over here.
