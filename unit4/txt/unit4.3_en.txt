Let me now change the action model into a different model.

We have 3 actions. Here is the first. I can go just forward. The second one is I can turn left and then go forward. And the third one is I can turn right and then go forward. So in all of these actions, I take a step forward. In the left one, I don't turn at all. The center one over here I turn left and go forward. This one over here I turn right and go forward.

Let's say for the time being the cost of each of those is 1. What is now the total cost of the optimal path to the goal?
