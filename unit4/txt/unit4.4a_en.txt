And this was a tricky question.  This was a tricky question, it's 15, turns out.

The path stays the same. I haven't punished left turns enough. Let me just try this.

If I were to go forward, forward, forward, left, forward, forward, we accrue a total cost of 1, 2, 3, 13, 14, 15. You can arrive at the same 15 by taking the 6 steps it takes to the goal and add the extra 9 penalty it takes just for the turn itself, which is 10 minus 1, and you get 15.

Let me look at the possible other path, which would take the loop over here and avoid the left turn altogether: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16.

So the path around this loop over here has a cost of 16, which is more than 15.

We still prefer the left turn.
