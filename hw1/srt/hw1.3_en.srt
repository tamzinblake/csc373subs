1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
So, I'm now going to quiz you on Bayes Rule.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Say you own a house, and you know that the house might catch fire in your absence,

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,000
but the probability of it catching fire, "f" over here, is small.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
It's a 10th of a percent: 0.001.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Let's say every afternoon you talk to your neighbor, and every afternoon

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
you ask your neighbor, "Does my house burn?"

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Of course, you're a little bit paranoid if you do this, but for the sake of the argument,

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
let's just assume you do this every afternoon.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
This afternoon he comes back and says, "Yes, it burns," so B.

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
You happen to know that the neighbor is not very truthful.

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
In fact, every time you ask him a question,

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,000
you know there is a 0.1 chance, a 10% chance, the neighbor will just produce a lie

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
and a 0.9 chance the neighbor actually speaks the truth.

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
So you ask him exactly one question: "Does my house burn?"

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:59,000
He says, "Yes, it burns," but you know that the probability of this being a lie is 0.1.

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:05,000
So in applying Bayes Rule I'd like to first compute the non-normalized posterior, p bar

17
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:11,000
(bar now stands for non-normalized) of fire given the neighbor just called.

18
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:17,000
And the same for the opposite event of no fire given the neighbor just said, "yes, it burns".

19
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
After you've done this, I'd like you to compute the normalized values

20
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
that have to add up to 1.

21
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Please enter all 4 values for this homework assignment.
