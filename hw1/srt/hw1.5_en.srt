1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
So congratulations. You made it through homework assignment number 1.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
You learned about Monte Carlo robot localization

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
with a technique that I often call histogram filters.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
You've implemented it successfully and you learned a lot about statistics.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
This is all in just a single class. Congratulations - it's really awesome.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Now, next week we talk about Kalman filters and tracking other cars in traffic,

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
and we're going to implement our Kalman filter, so I'll see you in the next class.
