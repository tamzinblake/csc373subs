1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
So welcome to our very first homework assignment.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
This is number 1.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Just to recap, in the class we learned about localization.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
We learned about about histogram filters.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
And we programmed some in Python.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:26,000
So the homework assignment will cover this plus some very basic probability.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
In the first question, I'm going to ask you some very basic probability questions.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
We have a random variable X and probability 0.2.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
What's the probability of the complement?

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
We have 2 random variables, X and Y, whose probability individually is 0.2.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
And X and Y are independent.

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
What's the probability of the joint X, Y?

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
And we have the variable P(X) with probability 0.2,

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:57,000
and we have 2 conditionals, P(Y|X) and P(Y|¬X), both 0.6.

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
What's the probability of Y?

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Here you have to apply total probability.
