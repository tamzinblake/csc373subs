So congratulations. You made it through homework assignment number 1.

You learned about Monte Carlo robot localization with a technique that I often call histogram filters.

You've implemented it successfully and you learned a lot about statistics.

This is all in just a single class. Congratulations - it's really awesome.

Now, next week we talk about Kalman filters and tracking other cars in traffic, and we're going to implement our Kalman filter, so I'll see you in the next class.
