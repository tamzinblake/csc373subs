[Sebastian Thrun - Professor CS373, Andy Brown - Course Manager CS373]

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
[Andy:] Welcome to our first office hours. We've seen a lot of really good discussion in the forums.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,000
And now we have Professor Thrun here with me.  I'm Andy the moderator in the CS373 forum.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
So we're going to divide the questions into the course content questions,

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
and we're going to after that talk about some other questions,

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
things that are specific to Sebastian's work.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
So first course content question that a lot of people seemed to have questions about was

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
when we're talking about the sensing, you introduce these multipliers called

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
p_hit and p_miss, and you assign values 0.6 and 0.2.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
So, people were confused about where those numbers came from.

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
[Sebastian:] So this is something I just put in ad hoc when I explained it,

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
and later on they've become the measurement probabilities,

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
but I didn't want to start talking about probabilities without programming them first, so

14
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
p_hit would be what's the probability of, say, being next to a door and really seeing it,

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
and p_miss would be the probability of being next to a door and not seeing it.

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
There is usually actually four of those.

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
There's four measurement combinations -

18
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
the probability of seeing the right measurement under the assumption there is a door

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
under the assumption there is no door,

20
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
the probability of seeing the wrong measurement under these two assumptions,

21
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
but two of them are sufficient for the math.

22
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
[Andy:] Okay.  And in a related question about your own work, how do you assign these?

23
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
You said it was done ad hoc in this little example, but in really designing a robot car,

24
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
how do you decide on what these values are going to be?

25
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Is it done experimentally? Is it based on the parameters of the sensors?

26
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
[Sebastian:] Yeah that's where a lot of meat comes in, and it's certainly meat I didn't really cover in class.

27
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I do cover it in my book.

28
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
It depends a lot on the sensor.

29
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
So for example if I use a camera, I use a different model than if I use a range finder.

30
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
We use a lot of laser range finders.

31
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
If I was using a laser range finder - they measure distances -

32
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
and it's not p_hit/p_miss anymore, it's the probability of measuring

33
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
a certain distance in a certain location.

34
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
The very first approximation is physics.

35
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
You can actually derive what is the typical noise in the sensor and characterize this.

36
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
But when you just use physics, you often have a very poor account on the actual uncertainty,

37
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
so when tuning those parameters, we often do this very experimentally.

38
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
We go in and try out certain parameters to see which ones work

39
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
and then often soften them to make them fit the math.

40
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:18,000
[Andy:] Okay.  So the next question a lot of people had was, is this  method we're using,

41
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
does it depend on the robot already having a map of its environment?

42
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
[Sebastian:] Localization does depend on having a map of the environment.

43
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Everything I taught so far assumes there is a map.

44
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
There is an entire field called simultaneous localization and mapping,

45
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:36,000
or for short, SLAM, that addresses the more general problem of acquiring a map at the same time,

46
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
and I haven't covered this in class.

47
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,000
[Andy:] Okay.  Those were two of the most heavily voted course content questions.

48
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
So in a real localizer, I guess you sort of addressesed this, but what are we looking for?

49
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
We're not looking for doors. We're looking for...?

50
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
[Sebastian:] Yeah, so in the Google self-driving car, which is a good example,

51
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
we actually have a map of the ground that is not that dissimilar from the way

52
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Google Earth projects images on the ground.

53
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
And then you can think of the robot having a laser camera, but a camera, that

54
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
produces local maps, and these local maps have some of the same features

55
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
like lane markings, as our global map.

56
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
And then the probability match question is one where we take the local map,

57
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
superimpose it on the global map, and see where it matches the best.

58
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
It's a search usually in x and y space.

59
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
It's also a little search on orientation space, because you might have your orientation slightly wrong.

60
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
The likelihood function that replaces our p_hit and p_miss

61
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
is then usually a correlation function that says how well does the local map

62
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
that you see right now match the global map.

63
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
And when you shift it to the right position, it usually matches much, much better,

64
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
and as a result you get a much larger probability.

65
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
[Andy:] Alright.  And so, some people were worrying about whether changing road conditions,

66
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
whether different weather, lighting conditions, things like that,

67
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
would greatly affect the usability of the robot car.

68
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
[Sebastian:] That's a great question, and we discuss this every day.

69
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Turns out that in certain weather conditions the car is relatively robust right now.

70
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Rain, for example, changes the total appearance of the street,

71
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
and we can adjust this with a single constant factor that adjusts

72
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
the total brightness of the laser map.

73
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Other things like a complete snow-covered street we have no solution right now it turns out.

74
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
So, what we're doing right now is we just don't drive in snow.

75
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
We live in California. There's not much snow here.

76
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
And when there is snow, we just tell the driver not to use the system.

77
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
That's something we have to work on.

78
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I think as we move into things like snow and some very massive changes, we have to reference to other features.

79
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Maybe there's trees around or other structures or rocks.

80
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Typically, snow comes in the mountains so maybe there's mountainous structure.

81
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
And we have to toss some of that information into the system.

82
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
[Andy:] Okay, so there's been a... People are getting very excited in the forums.

83
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
They want to actually build their own robotic car.

84
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Some questions have been how much is it going to cost?

85
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:50,000
If I can't do it because the cost is too high, can I get some Legos and build a robotic car that way?

86
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
[Sebastian:] So there's a lot of kits you can buy.

87
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I love Lego Mindstorms, which is a wonderful way to experiment with these things.

88
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
There's a lot of low-cost robot platforms you can buy.

89
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I don't really recommend to hack into your car.

90
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:09,000
The reason is the moment you start snipping wires, your car might actually become really unsafe.

91
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
So if you do work with a car, make sure you never, ever

92
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
drive this car manually again or you know what you're doing.

93
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
We've actually been really tapping into cars,

94
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
and we've done things like decoding and understanding

95
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
how you use an electric steering booster to turn this into a steering motor

96
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:30,000
so that the car would be able to steer on computer command not just on human command.

97
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
But it's a lot of work, and it's actually very risky, so don't do it yourself.

98
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Rather go and buy yourself a Lego Mindstorm or something similar and play with it.

99
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
You can actually study a lot of the same stuff using a Lego kit.

100
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
If you make a Lego robot move from the kitchen to the living room, that's actually really impressive.

101
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:51,000
[Andy:] Okay. I guess one last question is for the people who are especially enthusiastic about robotics and AI.

102
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,000
How do you get involved in this field? What can someone do after taking this course?

103
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
[Sebastian:] So take this class.

104
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:02,000
As you know, we've been handing the CVs of our top students onto various companies

105
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,000
like Amazon and Twitter and Facebook and Google.

106
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
That's one way to get involved.

107
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
That doesn't work for everybody.

108
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:16,000
The way I got involved is, for one, I had a lot of toys that you could program.

109
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I had a computer. I had little things to move around.

110
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
There was a construction set in Germany which I could play with as a kid.

111
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
And then I really started becoming a scientist.

112
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
So I started publishing papers.

113
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I started solving problems that the literature left open -

114
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
look into those and see if I could make a contribution.

115
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,000
At the age of about 22, I had my first big, big paper that was at a major conference.

116
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
And that kind of started me to get into the field and got me really hooked.

117
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:50,000
The nice thing is I think there's many, many problems around you that require the same technology.

118
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
There's tracking problems, estimation problems all over the place, right?

119
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
So if you can't afford a robot, why not just by a web camera and put it in your kitchen

120
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,000
and have it, for example, track whether your cooking is good or bad?

121
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
That's something that everybody can do with the same technology.

122
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Like today, most cooks occasionally boil water over and then it makes your stove wet.

123
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Can you build a system that prevents this?

124
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
That's a robotic task that uses the same technology.

125
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,000
If you do this and do this really, really well, you might start a business.

126
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
You might find other people to work with you.

127
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,000
You might show it to a local professor, and if they got excited about it, they might publish it at a conference.

128
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
There are many, many ways into the system, honestly.

129
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Just be creative about it.

130
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
[Andy:] Okay.  It sounds like you're emphasizing you have to think like a roboticist.

131
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
That's, I think, what this class is going to help to do.

132
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
[Sebastian:] Yeah, what I'm trying to do is make people think like roboticists.

133
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I'm extremely excited that in this class you get to program it yourself.

134
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,000
That's a new thing. When I was a student, I didn't have that possibility.

135
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
In our previous class you couldn't do it.

136
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
We are not at the point where you can drive your own robot around yet.

137
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
And I hope to get to this point where we have a good robot simulator so you can play with this.

138
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,000
But we have enough stuff you can just buy here.

139
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Most importantly a camera, like a camera on a phone.

140
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
You can do localization on a hand-held phone in a room, right, using images.

141
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:09,000
And if you do a really fantastic job, you can start a company and sell it to one of the major players.

142
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Because it's an open problem to the present day how to do this really well.

143
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
So there's a lot of technology available today that allows you

144
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
to think like a roboticist and still solve the interesting problems, with this class, I hope.

145
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
[Andy:] All right. Well, thank you very much.

146
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
[Sebastian:] Okay. Thank you.
