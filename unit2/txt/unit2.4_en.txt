So now I'd like you to do the same thing 6 times to emulate the 5 times of getting up in the middle of the night, subtracting a 5th, and the next day we still give a coconut to the monkey, and the resulting number is still divisible by 5.

So please enter your code somewhere in here, so we can test the same thing again with function f6.
