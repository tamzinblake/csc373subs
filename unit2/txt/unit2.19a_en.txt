And with a little bit of math we find that the new mean is 12.4, and the new σ² is 1.6. 12.4 is much closer to 13 than 10, and that's because the Gaussian centered on 13 has a much narrower variance than the one on 10.

And we find the resulting variance is smaller than each of the two variances over here. In particular, let's start with the variance. 1 over 1/8 plus 1/2 is the same as 1 over 5/8, which results to 8/5 or 1.6. This is just applying this formula over here. For the weighted average we get 2 times 10 plus 8 times 13. And then we normalize by the sum of those two things over here. So this is 124 divided by 10, gives us 12.4.
