Let's do this again.

Suppose our mean is 10 and 13, and the variances are imbalanced, 8 and 2, which corresponds to the following picture.

There's a relatively shallow distribution centered on 10 and a much more peaky distribution centered on 13. Compute for me what the resulting μ' and σ²' prime are.
