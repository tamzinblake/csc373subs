So this program over here is not quite the shortest. You could just plug in the number directly, but it gets us there.

And of course, as I hit "run" I get our desired solution. So this is my teaser. Obviously, my class is about artificial intelligence, not about questions and puzzles like these.

But we will learn to solve hard problems in building self-driving cars using exactly the same thing: a napkin, a tablet, and a Python interpreter.
