And the answer is the third, because that's the one that's most certain, and because it's most certain, it makes a chance of accidentally hitting another car the smallest just by the fact that we know more about the car than in the two other distributions.

So you learned something really important. You learned the definition of a Gaussian. You learned about the fact that these are unimodal distributions. They are also symmetrical.

And you learned a little bit about how to use them as a belief in a probabilistic filter.

So let's go and program a Gaussian.
