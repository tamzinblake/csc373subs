And the answer is right over here. Why?

If our current starting point is the point over here, for which we know the location is 1, and the velocity is 1, and if we predict 1 time step in the future, then for that prediction, we know that the location will be 2, and the velocity might be a little bit uncertain, but it stays about the same.

So we end up with a point over here. Let's do this again.
