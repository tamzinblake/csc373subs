And the approximate answer is 0.12.

(x minus Î¼) squared is 4, which is 10 minus 8 to the square divided by 4 equals 1.

So the expression of the exponential is -1/2, which is about 0.6.

And this guy over here is approximately 0.2, which gives us as a product 0.12

So I won't torture you with any more questions like these, because they're really not fun, but we can program this now.
