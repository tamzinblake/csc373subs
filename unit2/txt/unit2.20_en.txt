Let me ask a different quiz, which follows from the math, but it tests your intuition.

Suppose we have a prior that sits over here and a measurement probability that sits over here, really far away, and both have the same covariance.

Let me first quiz you where the new mean would be. Is it going to be here, here, here, or here? Please check the corresponding check mark.
