Now let's write a test for integer, which returns "true" if n is an integer.

There are many ways to write such a test. One is to compare n with the integer version of n and make sure that the absolute difference is smaller than a very small threshold. So if you apply this is_int test to f6(96), we fail, so 96 is not a valid number.

So with all of this, I'd like you to write the final solution for the problem.

Can you go through all the numbers until you find one that is a correct solution? And as a hint, the smallest number I find is this one: 15,621.
