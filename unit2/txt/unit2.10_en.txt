So let me ask you again about your intuition and draw three more Gaussians, and, again, excuse my poor drawing skills here.

And now I'm going to ask you about the covariance.

So for each of those check exactly one box. Is the covariance large, medium, or small? Obviously, one of those is the largest, one is the medium, and one is small.
