1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
So I'd like to take my students on a little journey to Stanford

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,000
and show them our self-driving car that uses sensors to sense the environment.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
So let me dive into the class pretty much right now.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
So in our last class, we talked about localization.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
We had a robot that lived in an environment and that could use its sensors

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
to determine where in the environment it is.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:35,000
So here you can see the Google self-driving car using a road map localizing itself.

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
But in addition, what's shown here in red are measurements of other vehicles.

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:48,000
The car uses lasers and radars to track other vehicles and today we're going to talk about how to find other cars.

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
The reason why I would like to find other cars is because we wouldn't want to run into them.

11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
So we have to understand how to interpret sensor data to make assessments,

12
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
not just where these other cars are as in the localization case,

13
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
but also how fast they're moving

14
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
so you can drive in a way that avoids collisions with them in the future.

15
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
That's important, not just for cars.

16
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
It matters for pedestrians and for bicyclists.

17
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
And understanding where other cars are and making predictions where they're going to move

18
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
is absolutely essential for safe driving in the Google car project.

19
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
So in this class we're going to talk about tracking.

20
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
The technique I'd like to teach you is called a Kalman filter.

21
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
This is an insanely popular technique for estimating the state of a system.

22
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
It's actually very similar to the probabilistic localization method

23
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
we taught in the previous class: Monte Carlo localization.

24
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
The primary differences are that Kalman filters estimate a continuous state

25
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:56,000
whereas in Monte Carlo localization we are voiced to chop the world into discrete places.

26
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
And as a result, the Kalman filter happens to give us a unimodal distribution,

27
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
and I'll tell you in a second what that means,

28
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
whereas Monte Carlo was fine with multimodal distributions.

29
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Both of these techniques are applicable to robot localization and tracking other vehicles.

30
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
In fact, in a later class, we're going to learn about particle filters,

31
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
which are yet another way to address the same problem,

32
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
and indeed they are actually continuous and multimodal.

33
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
But for the time being let's look into Kalman filters

34
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
and ignore these other two families of methods.

35
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Let me start with a example. Consider the car down here.

36
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Let's assume the it sees as its measurement, an object here, here, here,

37
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,000
and here for the times t = 0, t = 1, t = 2, and t = 3.

38
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Where would you assume the object would be at t = 4? Check one of those 3 boxes.
