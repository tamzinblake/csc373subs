1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
And with a little bit of math we find that the new mean is 12.4,

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
and the new σ² is 1.6.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:16,000
12.4 is much closer to 13 than 10, and that's because the Gaussian centered on 13

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
has a much narrower variance than the one on 10.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:25,000
And we find the resulting variance is smaller than each of the two variances over here.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
In particular, let's start with the variance.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:39,000
1 over 1/8 plus 1/2 is the same as 1 over 5/8, which results to 8/5 or 1.6.

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
This is just applying this formula over here.

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,000
For the weighted average we get 2 times 10 plus 8 times 13.

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
And then we normalize by the sum of those two things over here.

11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
So this is 124 divided by 10, gives us 12.4.
