1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
And the answer is the third, because that's the one that's most certain,

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
and because it's most certain, it makes a chance of accidentally

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
hitting another car the smallest just by the fact that we know more about the car

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
than in the two other distributions.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
So you learned something really important.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
You learned the definition of a Gaussian.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
You learned about the fact that these are unimodal distributions.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
They are also symmetrical.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
And you learned a little bit about how to use them as a belief in a probabilistic filter.

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
So let's go and program a Gaussian.
