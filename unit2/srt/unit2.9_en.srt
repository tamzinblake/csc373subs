00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
You remember our Markov model where the world was divided into discrete grids,

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
and we assigned to each grid cell a probability.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Such a representation of probability over spaces is called a histogram

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,000
in that it divides the continuous space into discrete, into finitely many grid cells

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,000
and approximates the posterior distribution by a histogram over the original distribution.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
And the histogram is a mere approximation for this continuous distribution.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
In Kalman filters the distribution is given by what's called a Gaussian.

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
A Gaussian is a continuous function over the space of locations,

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
and the area underneath sums up to 1.

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
So here's our Gaussian again.

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,000
And if we call the space x, then the Gaussian is characterized by two parameters,

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:01,000
the mean, often abbreviated with the Greek letter μ, and the width of the Gaussian,

13
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
often called the variance, and for reasons I don't want to go into,

14
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
it's often written as a quadratic variable σ².

15
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:16,000
So any Gaussian in 1D, which means the parameter space over here is 1 dimensional,

16
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
is characterized by μ and σ².

17
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
So rather than estimating the entire distribution as a histogram,

18
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,000
our task in Kalman filters is to maintain a μ and a σ² that is our best estimate

19
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
of the location of the object we're trying to find.

20
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:40,000
The exact formula is an exponential of a quadratic function where we take

21
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
the exponent of this complicated expression over here.

22
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:51,000
The quadratic difference of our query point x relative to the mean μ

23
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
divided by σ² multiplied by -1/2.

24
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Now, if x equals μ then the numerator becomes 0,

25
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
and we have exp of 0, which is 1.

26
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
It turns out we have to normalize this by a constant,

27
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
1 over the square root of 2πσ²,

28
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,000
but for everything we'll talk about today, this constant won't matter, so ignore it.

29
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
What matters is we have an exponential of a quadratic function over here.

30
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Let me draw you a couple of functions, and you tell me which ones you believe

31
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
are Gaussian by checking the box on the right side.

32
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
And please excuse my poor drawing skills here.
