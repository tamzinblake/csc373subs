1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:05,000
And the answer is this is the largest covariance. It's the widest spread.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
This is the smallest, and this is medium.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
And to see how this is being found in the formula over here,

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
the difference between x and y is being normalized by the covariance.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
So the larger this value, the less the difference over here matters,

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
and, as a result, the more the function is spread out.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
So functions with a very wide spread have the largest covariance,

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
whereas functions with small spread have the smallest covariance.

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Put differently, the σ² covariance is a measure of uncertainty.

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
The larger σ², the more uncertain we are about the actual state.

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
This is a very certain distribution where expected deviation is small.

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
This is a relatively uncertain distribution where we know very little.
