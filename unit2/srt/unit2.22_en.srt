1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
So let's now go back and write a program

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:09,000
in which we calculate the new mean and the new variance term.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
So I really just want you to write a Python program

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
that implements those equations so that we can test them.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I'm giving you a skeleton program, which has a function "update",

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
that takes as an input a mean and a variance for the first distribution

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
and a mean and a variance for the second distribution

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,000
and outputs the new mean and the new variance of the product of those.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
And here I'm testing it with a mean of 10 and a variance of 8,

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
and a mean of 13 and a variance of 2, which was one of our examples.

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
And out should come the answer over here: 12.4 and 1.6.

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Of course, Python tends to not give you the exact output,

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
so there's a couple of zeros over here but ignore those.

14
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:01,000
The answer is effectively 12.4 and 1.6. Can you fill in those gaps?
