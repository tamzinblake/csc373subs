00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Welcome to my second class on Kalman filters.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I want to take you on a little tour to where it all began, Stanford University.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Behind me is VAIL, Stanford's Automotive Research Center.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
And let's go inside.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
This is Junior, Standord's most recent self-driving car.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
It's the child of Stanley, whom you can find

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
in the National Museum of American History in Washington, D.C.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
And let me tell you something about the equipment that's on this car that makes it self-driving.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
So this rotating thing over here is a laser-range finder

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
that takes distance scans 10 times a second, about a million data points.

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
It'll be really important for the Kalman filter class I'm teaching you today.

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Its major function is to spot other cars so you don't run into them.

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
There is also a camera on top. There is a stereo camera system over here.

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
And in the rear there are antennas for a GPS (global positioning system)

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
that allows us to estimate where the car is in the world.

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
This is a supplemental system to the localization class I just taught you.

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
This is the data that comes from the laser.

18
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
This is the car parked in the garage right now. We see the back wall.

19
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
These are all range measurements that tell you how far things are away,

20
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
and they are essential as the input to the Kalman filter that we're going to learn about today.
