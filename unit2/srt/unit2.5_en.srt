1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Now let's write a test for integer,

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
which returns "true" if n is an integer.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
There are many ways to write such a test.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
One is to compare n with the integer version of n and make sure

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
that the absolute difference is smaller than a very small threshold.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:31,000
So if you apply this is_int test to f6(96), we fail, so 96 is not a valid number.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
So with all of this, I'd like you to write the final solution for the problem.

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Can you go through all the numbers until you find one that is a correct solution?

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:52,000
And as a hint, the smallest number I find is this one: 15,621.
