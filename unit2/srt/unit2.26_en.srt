1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
So now we understand a lot about the 1D Kalman filter.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
You've programmed one. You understand how to incorporate measurements.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
You understand how to incorporate motion,

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
and you really implemented something that's actually really cool,

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
which is a full Kalman filter for the 1D case.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Now in reality, we often have many Ds,

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
and then things become more involved, so I'm going to just tell you how things work

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,000
with an example, and why it's great to estimate in higher dimensional state spaces.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Suppose you have a 2-dimensional state space of x and y, like a camera image,

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:43,000
or in our case, we might have a car that uses a radar to detect the location

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
of a vehicle over time.

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Then what the 2D Kalman filter affords you is something really amazing,

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
and here is how it goes.

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Suppose at time t = 0, you observe the object of interest to be at this coordinate.

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
This might be another car in traffic for the Google self-driving car.

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
One time step later, you see it over here.

17
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Another time step later, you see it right over here.

18
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Where would you now expect at time t = 3 the object to be?

19
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Let me give you 3 different places.

20
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Please click at the most likely location.
