1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:05,000
And the answer is to set it to the same value as mu,

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
in which case this expression over here becomes 0, and we get the maximum.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
We get the peak of the Gaussian.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,000
So we set x to the same value as mu, to 10, and the output is 0.2 approximately.
