1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
In Kalman filter land, we're going to build a 2-dimensional estimate.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:12,000
1 for the location, and 1 for the velocity denoted x dot.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,000
The velocity can be zero. It can be negative, or it can be positive.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
If initially I know my location, but not my velocity,

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,000
then I represent it with a Gaussian that's elongated around the correct location,

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
but really, really broad in the space of velocities.

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Now let's look at the prediction step.

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
In the prediction step, I don't know my velocity,

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
so I can't possibly predict what location I'm going to assume.

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
But miraculously, they'll be some interesting correlation.

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
So let's for a second, just pick a point on this distribution over here.

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Let me assume my velocity is 0.

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Of course, in practice, I don't know the velocity,

14
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
but let me assume for a moment the velocity is 0.

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Where would my posterior be after the prediction?

16
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Well, we know we started in location 1.

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
The velocity is 0, so my location would likely be here.

18
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Now let's change my belief in the velocity and pick a different one.

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Let's say the velocity is 1.

20
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Where would my prediction be 1 time step later starting at location 1 and velocity 1?

21
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'll give you 3 choices.

22
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Here? Here? Or here?

23
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Please pick the one that makes most sense.
