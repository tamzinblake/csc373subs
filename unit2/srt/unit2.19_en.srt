1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Let's do this again.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Suppose our mean is 10 and 13, and the variances are imbalanced, 8 and 2,

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
which corresponds to the following picture.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
There's a relatively shallow distribution centered on 10

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
and a much more peaky distribution centered on 13.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Compute for me what the resulting μ' and σ²' prime are.
