1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
And the answer for the new mean is just the one in the middle,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
and reason is both weights over here are equivalent,

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
so we take the mean between μ and ν, which is 11.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
And then with σ² it's 2.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:25,000
If you take 1/4 plus 1/4, then you get 1/2, so 1 over 1/2 equals 2,

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,000
which means the new variance term is half the size of the previous variance terms.
