1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
And the approximate answer is 0.12.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:13,000
(x minus μ) squared is 4, which is 10 minus 8 to the square

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
divided by 4 equals 1.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
So the expression of the exponential is -1/2,

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
which is about 0.6.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:32,000
And this guy over here is approximately 0.2, which gives us as a product 0.12

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
So I won't torture you with any more questions like these, because they're really not fun,

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
but we can program this now.
