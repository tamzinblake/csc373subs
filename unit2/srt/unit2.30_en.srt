1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
When you put all this together, you find that all these possibilites on the Gaussian over here,

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
link to a Gaussian that looks like this.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,000
And this is a really interesting 2-dimensional Gaussian, which you should really think about.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Clearly, if you were to project this Gaussian uncertainty into the space of possible locations,

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I can't predict a thing. It's impossible to predict where the object is.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
And the reason is, I don't know the velocity.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Also, clearly if I project this Gaussian into the space of x dot,

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
then it is impossible to say what the velocity is.

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
A single observation or single prediction is insufficient to make that observation.

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:47,000
However, what we know is our location is correlated to the velocity.

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
The faster I move, the further on the right is the location.

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
And this Gaussian expresses this.

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
If I, for example, figured out that my velocity was 2, then I was able, under this Gaussian,

14
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
to really nail that my location is 3.

15
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
That is really remarkable.

16
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
You still haven't figured out where you are, and we haven't figured out how fast we're moving,

17
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
but we've learned so much about the relation of these 2 things with this Gaussian.

18
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:20,000
To understand how powerful this is, let's now fold in the second observation at time t = 2.

19
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:26,000
This observation tells us nothing about the velocity and only something about the location.

20
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
So if I were to draw this as a Gaussian, it's a Gaussian just like this,

21
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
which says something about the location but not about the velocity.

22
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:41,000
But if we now multiply by prior from the prediction step with the measurement probability,

23
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
then miraculously, I get a Gaussian that sits right over here.

24
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
And this Gaussian now has a really good estimate what my velocity is

25
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
and a really good estimate of where I am.

26
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:00,000
If I take this Gaussian, and predict 1 step forward, then I find myself right over here.

27
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
That's exactly the effect we have over here.

28
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,000
As I update this I get a Gaussian like this, I predict right over here.

29
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Think about this. This is really deep insight about how Kalman filters work.

30
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,000
In particular, we've only been able to observe 1 variable.

31
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,000
We've been able to measure observation to infer this other variable,

32
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
and the way we've been able to infer it is that there's a set of physical equations

33
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:34,000
which say that my location, after a time step, is my old location plus my velocity.

34
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:40,000
And this set of equations has been able to propagate constrains from subsequent measurements

35
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:46,000
back to this unobservable variable, velocity, so we are able to estimate the velocity as well.

36
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
This is really key to understanding Kalman filter.

37
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
It is key to understand how a Google self-driving car

38
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
estimates the locations of other cars, and is able to make predictions

39
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
even if it's unable to measure velocity directly.

40
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
So there's a big lesson here.

41
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,000
The variables of a Kalman filter, they're often called states because they reflect states

42
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,000
of the physical world like where is the other car and the fastest moving.

43
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,000
They separate into 2 subsets: the observables, like the momentary location,

44
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:24,000
and the hidden, which in our example is the velocity, which I can never directly observe.

45
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:30,000
But because those 2 things interact, subsequent observations of the observable variables

46
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:37,000
give us information about these hidden variables, so we can also estimate

47
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
what these hidden variables are.

48
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:44,000
So from multiple observations of the places of the object, the location,

49
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
we can estimate how fast it's moving.

50
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:52,000
That is actually true for all of the different filters but because Kalman filters happen to be

51
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
very efficient to calculate, when we have a problem like this,

52
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
you tend to often use just a Kalman filter.
