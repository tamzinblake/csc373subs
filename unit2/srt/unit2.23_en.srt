1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
So let's step a step back and look at what we've achieved.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
We knew there was a measurement update and a motion update,

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
which is also called prediction.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
And we know that the measurement update is implemented by multiplication,

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
which is the same as Bayes rule,

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:23,000
and the motion update is done by total probability or an addition.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
So we tackled the more complicated case.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
This is actually the hard part mathematically.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
And we solved this. We gave an exact expression.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
We even derived it mathematically,

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
and you were able to write a computer program that implements this step of the Kalman filter.

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I don't want to go into too much depth here.

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
This is a really, really easy step. Let me write it down for you.

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Suppose you live in a world like this.

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
This is your current best estimate of where you are,

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
and this is your uncertainty.

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
And now say you move to the right side a certain distance

18
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
and that motion itself has its own set of uncertainty.

19
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Then you arrive at a prediction that adds the motion of command to the mean,

20
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
and it has an increased uncertainty over the initial uncertainty.

21
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Intuitively this makes sense.

22
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
If you move to the right by this distance,

23
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
in expectation you're exactly where you wish to be

24
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
but you've lost information because your motion tends to lose information

25
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
as manifested by this uncertainty over here.

26
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Now the math for this is really, really easy.

27
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Your new mean is your old mean plus the motion, often called u.

28
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
So if you move over 10 meters, this will be 10 meters.

29
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
And your new σ² is your old σ²

30
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
plus variance of the motion Gaussian.

31
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
This is all you need to know. It's just an addition.

32
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
And I won't prove it to you because it's really trivial.

33
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
But in summary, we have a Gaussian over here,

34
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
we have a Gaussian for the motion, with u as the mean

35
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
and r² as its own motion uncertainty,

36
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,000
and the resulting Gaussian in the prediction step just adds these 2 things up:

37
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:13,000
μ plus u and σ² plus r².

38
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Since this was so simple, let me quiz you.

39
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
We have a Gaussian before the prediction step

40
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
which μ equals 8 and σ² equals 4.

41
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,000
We then move to the right a total of 10,

42
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
with a motion uncertainty of 6.

43
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Now describe to me the predictive Gaussian

44
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,000
and give me the new μ and the new σ².
