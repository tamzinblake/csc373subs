1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
So this program over here is not quite the shortest.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
You could just plug in the number directly, but it gets us there.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
And of course, as I hit "run" I get our desired solution.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
So this is my teaser.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Obviously, my class is about artificial intelligence,

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
not about questions and puzzles like these.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
But we will learn to solve hard problems in building self-driving cars

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
using exactly the same thing: a napkin, a tablet, and a Python interpreter.
