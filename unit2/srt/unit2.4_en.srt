1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
So now I'd like you to do the same thing 6 times to emulate the 5 times

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
of getting up in the middle of the night, subtracting a 5th,

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
and the next day we still give a coconut to the monkey,

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
and the resulting number is still divisible by 5.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
So please enter your code somewhere in here,

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
so we can test the same thing again with function f6.
