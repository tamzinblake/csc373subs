1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Suppose we multiply two Gaussians as in Bayes rule,

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
a prior and a measurement probability.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
And the prior has a mean of μ and a variance of σ².

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,000
The measurement has a mean of ν and a covariance of r².

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Then the new mean, μ', is the weighted sum of the old means

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,000
where μ is weighted by r², ν is weighted by σ²

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
normalized by the sum of those weighting factors.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
And the new variance term, I'm going to write σ²' here

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:46,000
for the new one after the update, is given by this equation over here.

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
So let's put this into action.

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
We have a weighted mean over here.

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Clearly, the prior Guassian has a much higher uncertainty.

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Therefore σ² is larger.

14
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
And that means that ν is weighted much, much larger than the μ.

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
So the mean will be closer to the ν than the μ,

16
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
which means that it'll be somewhere over here.

17
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Interestingly enough, the variance term is unaffected by the actual means.

18
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,000
It just uses the previous variances and comes up with a new one that's even peakier.

19
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
So the result might look like this.

20
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
So this is the common situation for the measurement update step

21
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:31,000
where this is the prior, this is the measurement probability, and this is the posterior.

22
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
So let's practice these equations with a simple quiz.

23
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
So here are our equations again.

24
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
And suppose I use the following Gaussians:

25
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,000
These are Gaussians with equal variance but different means that might look as follows.

26
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Compute for me the new mean after the update and the new σ².
