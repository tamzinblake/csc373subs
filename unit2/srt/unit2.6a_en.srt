1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
The answer is 2499.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
It's just 12,495 divided by 5,

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
and the remainder becomes 9996.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
When you work this out for all iterations of the puzzle,

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
you'll find that in the morning when they wake up

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
there's 5116 coconuts left, just about a third.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:35,000
The monkey gets 1, and each of the people take with them yet another 1023 coconuts.

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Now, why is this an interesting quiz?

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Because there's another solution.

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,000
That one is really hard, but it's also very elegant; very, very elegant.

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Let me build up the solution by finding a really simple number that

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
satisfies the variance of giving 1 to the monkey, removing a 5th.

13
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Now, such a number is impossible to find in the set of positive numbers,

14
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
but here is one that works: -4.

15
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
If we subtract 1, you get -5.

16
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
If you now take a 5th away, which happens to be -1,

17
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
then the result is -4 again.

18
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:25,000
So you can keep doing this, and you'll always arrive at -4.

19
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:32,000
So -4 is a valid solution to the puzzle except it is negative,

20
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
and it's hard to think of negative numbers of coconuts.
