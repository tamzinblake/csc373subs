1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
So, in the next class, I'm going to teach you our final state estimation algorithm.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
It's called particle filters . And whereas the two first methods we learned,

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
the histogram method and now the Kalman method are really complex and involved,

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
this one is really simple and easy to implement and really powerful.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:27,000
We are using it in various places in the Google self-driving car.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
And it's possibly the most popular method to-date in recent times.

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
And it really overcomes some basic barriers in both of the 2 previous methods.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
It's also really fun to implement because you can implement it in about 5 lines of code,

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
which is quite amazing.

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:49,000
So, please come back when the next class comes and learn how to program a particle filter.
