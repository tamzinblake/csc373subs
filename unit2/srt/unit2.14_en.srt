1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
So now let's look at the Kalman filter.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
The Kalman filter represents all distributions by Gaussians.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
And just like in the last class where we talked about measurement cycles and motion cycles,

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:22,000
the Kalman filter iterates two different things: measurement updates and motion updates.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
So this is identical to the situation before in localization

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
where we got a measurement and then we took a motion.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Here the math changes, but the basic principle applies.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,000
So let's do a quiz to see if we remember the material from last class.

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
You might remember that one of the two steps, measurement or motion,

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
required a convolution and the other one a product.

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Please check the corresponding box.
