1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
And the answer is over here in the middle.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:10,000
It's between the two old means, the mean of the prior and the mean of the measurement.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
And it's slightly further on the measurement side,

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:19,000
because the measurement was more certain as to where the vehicle is than the prior.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:25,000
The more certain we are, the more we pull the mean in the direction of the certain answer.
