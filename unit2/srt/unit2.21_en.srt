00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Let me ask the hard question now.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Will it be a Gaussian like this where the variance is larger,

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
a Guassian with the exact same variance,

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
or an even more peaky Guassian that's more certain

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
than the two original factors in this calculation?

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Please check exactly one of the three boxes over here.
