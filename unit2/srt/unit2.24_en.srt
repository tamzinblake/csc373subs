1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
So let's program this.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
I'm giving you a skeleton code.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
This is the same update function as before.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
And now I would like you to do the predict function,

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
which takes our current estimate and its variance

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
and the motion and its uncertainty

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
and computes the new updated prediction, mean, and variance.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
So for example, if our prior is 10 and 4, our motion is 12 and 4,

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I would like to get out to 22 and 8 according to the formulas I've just given you.
