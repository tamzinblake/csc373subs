1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:05,000
And yes, you'd expect it right over here.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
From those observations you would say that the velocity

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
points in the direction of this vector.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
So assuming no drastic change in velocity,

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
you expect that the 5th position would be over here.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
So the Kalman filter takes observations like these

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
and estimates future locations and velocities based on data like this.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
And today I'm going to teach you how to write a piece of software

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
that lets you take points like those, even if they're noisy and uncertain,

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
and estimate automatically where future locations might be

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
and at what velocity the object is moving.

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
The Google self-driving car uses methods like these to understand

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
where other traffic is based on radar and laser-range data.

14
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
So let's dive in!
