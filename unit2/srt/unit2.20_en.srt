1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Let me ask a different quiz,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
which follows from the math, but it tests your intuition.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Suppose we have a prior that sits over here

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
and a measurement probability that sits over here, really far away,

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
and both have the same covariance.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Let me first quiz you where the new mean would be.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Is it going to be here, here, here, or here?

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Please check the corresponding check mark.
