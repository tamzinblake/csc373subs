1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
So 15,621 is indeed an answer.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Subtract 1 to the monkey.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
The first guy now takes 3124,

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
leaving to the next guy 12,496.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Again subtracting 1 gives us... please fill in the number for the second guy who wakes up.
