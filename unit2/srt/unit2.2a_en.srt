1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
So let's look at the way to solve this.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I'll give you two solutions, a straightforward one and an elegant one.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:15,000
In the straightforward one, you go from N0, N1, N2, all the way to N6,

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
which is divisible by 5.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
This is the initial number of coconuts.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
This is after the first guy woke up, the second, all the way to the fifth,

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
and this is the number of coconuts after the final coconut was given to the monkey.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
So now we know that for any of those, we can write the ith number of coconuts

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
is obtained from the previous number by subtracting 1, dividing by 5,

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
and multiplying by 4.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,000
And of course we want this to be an integer, and we want the initial number to be an integer.

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
How can we program a solution in Python?
