1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
So in Kalman filters we iterate measurement and motion.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
This is often called a "measurement update",

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
and this is often called "prediction".

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:17,000
And this update will use Bayes rule, which is nothing else but a product or a multiplication.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:24,000
And this update will use total probability, which is a convolution,

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
or simply an addition.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Let's talk first about the measurement cycle and then the prediction cycle,

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:44,000
using our great, great, great Gaussians for implementing those steps.

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
So suppose you're localizing another vehicle,

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
and you have a prior distribution that looks as follows.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
It's a very wide Gaussian with the mean over here.

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
And now, say we get a measurement that tells us something about

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
the localization of the vehicle, and it comes in like this.

14
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
It has a mean over here called ν,

15
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
and this example has a much smaller covariance for the measurement.

16
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
This is an example where in our prior we were fairly uncertain about a location,

17
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
but the measurement told us quite a bit as to where the vehicle is.

18
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
So here's a quiz for you.

19
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Will the new mean of the subsequent Gaussian be over here, over here, or over here?

20
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Check one of these three boxes.
