1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
And here's my answer. This is the expression for the mean.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
This is the one for the variance.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I run it, I get the exact same answer.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I run it again for my other example of equal variances and 10 and 12 as a mean,

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
and miraculously, the correct answer comes out:

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
11 for the new mean and 2 for the new variance squared.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
If you programmed this correctly, then congratulations!

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
You've just programmed an essential update step in the Kalman filter:

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
the measurement update step.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
That's really the difficult step in Kalman filtering.

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,000
The other one, the prediction step or the motion step, is much, much easier to program.
