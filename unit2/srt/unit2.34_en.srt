1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
So this completes my unit on Kalman filters. You learned actually quite a bit.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
You learned about Gaussians, how to do measurement updates using multiplication,

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,000
how to do prediction or state transitions using convolution,

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
and you even implemented your first Kalman filter, which is really super cool.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
You've implemented it in the context of vehicle tracking,

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
and you used this to estimate a nonobservable velocity for measurement data.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Now, next is your homework assignment.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I hope you can prove what you've learned and ace it.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
And then, next week, we're going to move into particle filters, which is an exciting third method for state estimation.

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
So I'll see you for the homework assignment, and then I'll see you in class for particle filters.
