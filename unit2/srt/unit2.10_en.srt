1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
So let me ask you again about your intuition

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,000
and draw three more Gaussians, and, again, excuse my poor drawing skills here.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
And now I'm going to ask you about the covariance.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
So for each of those check exactly one box.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Is the covariance large, medium, or small?

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Obviously, one of those is the largest, one is the medium, and one is small.
