1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:05,000
And very surprisingly, the resulting Gaussian

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
is more certain than the two component Gaussians.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,000
That is, the covariance is smaller than either of the two covariances in isolation.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
And intuitively speaking, this is the case because we actually gain information.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
The two Gaussians together have higher information content

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
than either Gaussian in isolation. So it'll look like something like this.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
And that is completely non-obvious.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
And you might have to take this with faith, but I can actually prove it to you.
