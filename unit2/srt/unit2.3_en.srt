1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Let's do this in stages.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Let's program a function f(n) that takes as an input number of coconuts,

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
and that outputs the number of coconuts after 1 was given to the monkey

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
and a 5th of those were removed.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
And let's test it with the number 96.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
It's your turn to program this function, and when you hit the run button,

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,000
we can look at the results, which for 96 I'd like to be 76.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
If we subtract 1 from 96, you have 95,

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,000
and if you now subtract a 5th of those, you end up with 76.

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,000
So please insert your function here and hit the run button to see 76 down here.
