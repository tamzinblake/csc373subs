1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,000
So the answer is tricky.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I'm going to use a variable n that I increment by 1 in this while loop over here.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
And I'm using a flag called "found" that I initialized with False.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
And so as long as I don't find a valid number, I just go up by 1 over here.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,000
And when I find it, I terminate the while loop, and I print the result.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
And this is the tricky part over here.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
So I'm testing the function f6 for is_int,

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
but when I pass my argument, I make sure it's actually a floating value argument,

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
not an integer; otherwise the procedure doesn't work.

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
This is a tricky part about Python and type treatment in Python.

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
This makes sure I'm using a floating point number,

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
and the loop over here when I hit run gives me 15,621.

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Did you get it?
