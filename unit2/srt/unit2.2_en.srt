1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
So here's a quiz.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Five guys and a monkey are stranded on an island.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
On the island are many coconut trees with many coconuts.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,000
The guys and the monkey spend all day collecting a huge pile of coconuts.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,000
When night falls, they are all very tired except for the monkey,

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
and they all fall asleep after they agreed

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
to divide the divide the coconuts into 5 equals part the next morning

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
and part different ways.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Now, in the middle of the night the first guy wakes up,

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:41,000
and he doesn't trust the others, so he decides to take his 5th right now and hide it,

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:48,000
but unfortunately, the number of coconuts is not divisible by 5.

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
However, if he gives one to the monkey, then the remainder is divisible by 5.

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
So he takes his 5th and hides it in a safe place.

14
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Afterwards, the guy falls asleep again.

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
The same scene now repeats 4 more times for each of the guys.

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:11,000
The next guy wakes up, realizes that remaining number N is still not divisible by 5,

17
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
but if he gives a coconut to the monkey, who now holds 2 coconuts,

18
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:22,000
then the remainder is divisible by 5, so he takes his 5th and hides it in a safe place.

19
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
And now, the guy falls asleep again.

20
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
The next guy wakes up, he gives 1 coconut to the monkey,

21
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
which makes the remainder divisible by 5.

22
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
He takes his 5th and hides it in a safe place before he falls asleep.

23
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
The monkey now holds 3 coconuts.

24
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:47,000
The fourth guy wakes up, same story, he has to give one to the monkey.

25
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
He takes his 5th, which of course now is much smaller than the original 5th

26
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
and hides it and falls asleep.

27
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,000
And finally, the fifth guy wakes up, and again, the number of coconuts remaining

28
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
is not divisible by 5, but as he gives 1 to the monkey,

29
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
the remainder becomes divisible by 5, so he takes his 5th and hides it in a safe place

30
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
before he falls asleep again.

31
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,000
As the sun rises, all 5 guys wake up at the same time,

32
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,000
and they all realize the mountain of coconuts has shrunk substantially,

33
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
but they can't say anything, because each of them took some away in the middle of the night.

34
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:29,000
So they decide to proceed as planned, but the number of coconuts, surprisingly,

35
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
is not divisible by 5.

36
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,000
By giving 1 more coconut to the monkey, the remainder is divisible by 5,

37
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
and each one takes his 5th, and then they part their ways,

38
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
leaving the monkey behind.

39
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Here's a question. How many coconuts has the monkey?

40
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Well, no. That's easy.

41
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,000
How many coconuts were there originally?
