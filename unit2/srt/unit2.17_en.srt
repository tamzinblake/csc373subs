00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Now, here's a question that's really, really hard.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:14,000
When we graph the new Gaussian, I can graph one that's very wide, that's very peaky.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
So if I were to measure where the peak of the new Gaussian is,

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
this would be a very narrow and skinny Gaussian.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
This would be one whose width would be inbetween the two Gaussians.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
And this is one that's even wider than the two original Gaussians.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Which one do you believe is the correct posterior after multiplying these two Gaussians?

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
This is an insanely hard question.

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I'd like you to take your chances here,

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
and I'll explain you the answer in just a second.
