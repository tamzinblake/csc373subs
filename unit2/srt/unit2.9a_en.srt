1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
And the answer is this one is a Gaussian, this one, and this one.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
And they are all characterized by this exponential drop-off on both sides

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
they're symmetrical, and they have a single peak.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
they're what's called "unimodal".

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
This is a bimodal function, it has two peaks, and as a result is not Gaussian.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
The same is true over here and over here,

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
so these guys don't qualify.
