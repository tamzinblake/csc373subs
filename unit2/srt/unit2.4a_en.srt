1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:05,000
So to solve this we're going to set up a loop for 6 times.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
We apply our diminishing rule n = f(n)

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
and then we simply return n.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Hitting the run button gives us 22.21, which is not an integer.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
And that's a failure--the final number has to be an integer as well as

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
all the numbers along the way, but I can tell you if the final number is an integer,

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
then the numbers in between will be as well.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Now important to know is I put a decimal point over here.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
If I omit this, then all this reverts to integer calculation,

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
and I won't be able to test whether it is an integer.

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
It's really important to have the decimal point over here.
