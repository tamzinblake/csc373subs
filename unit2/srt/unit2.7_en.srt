1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,000
So let's see if we can find a positive solution.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:11,000
The second insight is that any solution can be increased by 5^6,

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
which is 15,625.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:22,000
So suppose N is a solution. We take 1 away, and we do this.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Then N + 15,625 will move to this number by subtracting 1,

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
which will move to this number over here.

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,000
And interestingly enough, this is the same as this expression over here,

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
factoring out the 5^6.

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Now, what's interesting is this expression over here

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
is the same as this expression over here.

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
So this works 6 times in a row if N is a valid solution.

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
This expression over here is now 5 times divisible by 5,

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
so we can plug this into the next iteration,

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
and what we end up with is something like this:

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
5^4 times 16.

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,000
We're going to go to 5^3 times 64 all the way while it's still divisible by 5.

17
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
It's still an integer number. We can do this 6 times.

18
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
So therefore, 5^6 minus 4 is a solution.

19
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
So now I want you to write the world's shortest Python program to solve this problem

20
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
that spits out a valid solution based on this insight.
