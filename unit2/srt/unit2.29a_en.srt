1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
And just like before, it'll be over here with a velocity of 2, initial position of 1,

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
we find ourselves in 3.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
And again, this model assumes that in the absence of more knowledge,

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
the velocity shouldn't really change.
