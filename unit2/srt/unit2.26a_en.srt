1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
And the answer is here.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
What the Kalman filter does for you, if you do estimation and high dimensional spaces,

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
is to not just go into x and y spaces,

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
but allows you to implicitly figure out what the velocity of the object is,

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
and then use this velocity estimate to make a really good prediction about the future.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Now notice the sensor itself only sees position.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
It never sees the actual velocity.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
The velocity is inferred from seeing multiple positions.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
So one of the most amazing things about Kalman filters in tracking applications is

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
that it's able to figure out, even though it never directly measures it,

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,000
the velocity of the object, and from there is able to make predictions about future locations

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
that incorporate velocity.

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
That is just really, really, really great.

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
And that's one of the reasons that Kalman filters are such a popular algorithm

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
in artificial intelligence and in control theory at large.
