1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
And the answer is the main diagonal remains one.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,000
This is expressing the effect that in the absence of any velocity,

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
we expect the x-coordinate and the y-coordinate not to change.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
We also don't expect the velocities to change.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:19,000
But the x-velocity will impact the x-position through a 0.1 over here.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
The third coordinate is the velocity, and it affects the first coordinate.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:30,000
The same over here. All the other values should be zero.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
So this is the 4-dimensional generalization

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
of this 2-dimensional state transition matrix over here.
