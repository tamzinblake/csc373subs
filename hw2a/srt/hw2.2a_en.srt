1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
And The answer is a 1/2 or 0.5

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
To see, let us multiply these two Gaussians over here,

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,949
which in the exponent becomes an addition.

4
00:00:10,949 --> 00:00:12,949
We can now rewrite this as follows:

5
00:00:12,949 --> 00:00:18,949
We bring the factor 2, for these 2 terms into the denominator

6
00:00:18,949 --> 00:00:21,000
as 1/2 σ²,

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
and from that we see that the new variance is 0.5

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,750
as large as the old one when applied to the squares.

9
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:33,500
So, as a result, you would have this equation over here.
