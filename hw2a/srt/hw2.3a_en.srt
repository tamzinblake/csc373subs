1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
The correct answer here is no.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Suppose we let x go to infinity,

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
then (x-μ)² for any fixed μ would go to infinity.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,750
So we have x to the -infinity, which would go to zero.

5
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:16,000
This is a constant.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Therefore, we know that in the limit of x goes to infinity,

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,750
this expression must be zero.

8
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:28,000
However, in this graph, it stays at α, and doesn't go to zero.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
So, therefore, there can't be a valid μ at σ².

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
If a deep improbability, you know that the area in the Gaussian

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
has to integrate into one,

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
and this area diverges, it is actually infinite in size,

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,500
so it's not even a valid execution.
